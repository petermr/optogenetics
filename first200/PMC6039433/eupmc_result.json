    "In Caenorhabditis elegans, which has only 302 neurons, relationships between behaviors and neural networks are not easily elucidated. In this study, we proposed a novel cellomics approach enabling high-throughput and comprehensive exploration of the functions of a single neuron or a subset of neurons in a complex neural network on a particular behavior. To realize this, we combined optogenetics and Brainbow technologies. Using these technologies, we established a C. elegans library where opsin is labeled in a randomized pattern. Behavioral analysis on this library under light illumination enabled high-throughput annotation of neurons affecting target behaviors. We applied this approach to the egg-laying behavior of C. elegans and succeeded in high-throughput confirmation that hermaphrodite-specific neurons play an important role in the egg-laying behavior. This cellomics approach will lead to the accumulation of neurophysiological and behavioral data of the C. elegans neural network, which is necessary for constructing neuroanatomically grounded models of behavior."
