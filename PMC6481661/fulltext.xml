Reward-related accumbal DA release dynamics are traditionally ascribed to ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons. Activation of VTA to NAc DA signaling is thought to reinforce action and transfer reward-related information to predictive cues&#x02019; allowing cues to guide behavior and elicit dopaminergic activity. Here, we use optogenetics to control DA neuron activity and voltammetry to simultaneously record accumbal DA release in order to quantify how reinforcer-evoked dopaminergic activity shapes conditioned mesolimbic DA transmission. We find that cues predicting access to DA neuron self-stimulation elicit conditioned responding and NAc DA release. However, cue-evoked DA release does not reflect the cost or magnitude of DA neuron activation.

Mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neuron projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) contribute to the selection and invigoration of appetitive behaviors driven by outcome-predictive cues (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Berridge, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">McClure et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Nicola, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Salamone and Correa, 2012</xref>). This is supported by evidence that VTA DA neuron firing and NAc DA release phasically increase following better than expected events and, as learning proceeds, the DA signal transfers along with action initiation to cues predicting access to the instigating stimulus (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). Phasic DA transmission is proposed to signal the utility of goal-directed action by scaling in magnitude according to reward value, such that larger or more probable rewards evoke greater dopaminergic activity that is subsequently reflected in the cue-evoked DA response (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">McClure et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Schultz et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, phasic activation of mesolimbic DA neurons is thought to reinforce appetitive action, signal value, and transfer this information to antecedent cues. Accordingly, the ability to elicit dopaminergic activity may allow rewards such as food or addictive drugs to function as goals and for cues to drive goal seeking (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Covey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Keiflin and Janak, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Redish, 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P7">Recent work supports this notion, demonstrating that DA neuron manipulations at the time of reward retrieval sufficiently modifies cue-directed reward seeking (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that the degree to which DA neurons are phasically excited (or inhibited) proportionally endows predictive cues with an expectation of reward value. However, the degree to which cue-evoked mesolimbic DA signaling and behavior reflect reward-evoked DA release is poorly understood. Here, we used optogenetics to control DA neuron function and behavior while simultaneously monitoring its effect on NAc DA release using voltammetry in mice performing intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) for optogenetic excitation of VTA DA neurons. This approach allowed us to precisely quantify how NAc DA release tracks DA-neuron-mediated reinforcement and identify what information about phasic DA neuron activation is incorporated into the cue-evoked DA response and behavior. We found that cues predicting access to optical ICSS elicited NAc DA release as mice learned the cuereinforcer contingency and declined when the reinforcer was withheld, indicating that VTA DA neuron activation sufficiently endows cues with conditioned reinforcing properties. However, cue-evoked NAc DA release was not modified by the magnitude or cost of DA neuron activation. Thus, NAc DA release tracks predicted DA-neuron-mediated reinforcement but does not necessarily incorporate information about the expected utility or magnitude of DA neuron activation.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3"><title>Controlling and Monitoring DA Function and Behavior</title><p id="P8">An adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector was used to express the excitable opsin <italic>ChR2</italic> in VTA DA neurons of DAT::Cre<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice, an optical fiber was placed above the injection site to conduct light stimulation, and a carbon fiber microelectrode was implanted in the NAc to record DA concentration changes using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). Laser stimulation (473 nm, 1 s, 30 Hz) maintained robust ICSS on a fixed ratio (FR) 1 continuous reinforcement (CRF) schedule (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Mice continued to seek self-stimulation at high rates despite an increase in response requirement (lever presses per stimulation) and a decrease in stimulations earned. To assess whether DA release accompanies behavior driven by activation of DA neurons, we monitored NAc DA release during ICSS on an FR1 CRF schedule (n = 20 sessions, 9 mice). Behavioral and FSCV measures from representative mice are shown in <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>.</p><p id="P9">Initiation of lever pressing evoked an immediate increase in the FSCV signal that diminished (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) or plateaued (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>) as responding continued. We compared the amplitude of individual optically evoked DA release events (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>) to the inter-stimulation interval (ISI; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) across the session and found that ICSS-evoked DA release (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) covaried with the ISI (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, inset), such that less DA release was associated with more vigorous responding (i.e., lower ISI). To assess whether changes in response vigor or time between stimulations differentially associated with DA release, a subset of mice (n = 4) were exposed to increasing fixed ratio requirements during separate ICSS sessions, which necessarily increased the ISI (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) without significantly altering the response rate (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The evoked DA concentration also increased along with the response requirement (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>) and was highly correlated with the ISI across all FR schedules (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), indicating that the time between consecutive stimulations, rather than effortful investment, restrains optically evoked NAc DA release. By comparing the amplitude of the evoked DA signal to the first stimulation of the session, we identified 15 s as a minimal interval for obtaining consistent release events (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>DA Release during ICSS Seeking</title><p id="P10">To assess whether phasically activating DA neurons is indeed sufficient to promote conditioned, appetitive encoding of incentive cues, mice were trained to seek optogenetic ICSS during 120-min sessions on a variable timeout (VTO; 30&#x02013;90 s) schedule in response to a cue indicating forthcoming access to laser stimulation (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Oleson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Owesson-White et al., 2008</xref>). The latency to press the active lever following cue presentation serves as a proxy of the cue&#x02019;s learned association with forthcoming reinforcement. Behavior and DA measures from a representative session are shown in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>. Latency to respond decreased over time and reached an asymptote at a low level during later trials (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). DA concentration changes plotted relative to cue onset and across consecutive trials (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) were inversely associated with latency, such that the peak DA concentration during cue presentation (5&#x02013;10 s) gradually increased and persisted at a higher level during later trials (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). In contrast, and despite constant stimulation parameters and a sufficient ISI for evoking a consistent DA signal (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>), stimulated release progressively declined during the session (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). On average, cue-evoked and stimulation-evoked DA release tracked behavior in the opposite direction; more vigorous responding (i.e., lower response latency) was associated with increased and decreased DA release to the cue and stimulation, respectively (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). The relationship between behavior and NAc DA release was clearest during the first 50 trials, before latency reached an asymptote (i.e., during learning), and persisted across the first 200 trials (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). DA release to the cue and stimulation were stable across 3 consecutive sessions (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>), indicating that changes in the DA response over time are not likely due to declining electrode performance. Collectively, these findings show that phasic activation of VTA DA neurons sufficiently supports dopaminergic encoding of predictive cues.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>DA Release and Expected ICSS Cost</title><p id="P11">To assess whether information associated with phasic DA neuron activation is concomitantly reflected by changes in cue-evoked behavior and NAc DA release, we first manipulated the cost of VTA DA neuron ICSS (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The task structure on each trial is the same as in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, but the response requirement changed (FR1, 5, 10, 20, 1) across consecutive 30-min epochs. The additional FR1 period at the end of the session served as an internal control to assess whether behavior and DA function or its detection changed over time, independent of response requirement.</p><p id="P12">Mice proportionally increased responding (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and required more time (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) to earn a similar number of stimulations across all response requirements, except FR20 (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). The 20-press response requirement was sufficient to hinder responding, as evidenced by a significant increase in the time to initiate lever pressing (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), number of trial omissions (one-way repeated measures [RM] ANOVA: F<sub>(4</sub>,<sub>20)</sub> = 3.80, p = 0.02; p &#x0003c; 0.05, FR20 versus all epochs, data not shown), and inactive lever presses (one-way RM ANOVA: F<sub>(4,20)</sub> = 4.12, p = 0.014; p &#x0003c; 0.05, FR20 versus all epochs; data not shown). DA concentration changes from a representative session are plotted relative to cue onset and across consecutive trials in <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>. Surprisingly, the amount of DA released during cue presentation or by laser stimulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4F</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>) did not significantly differ as a function of the response requirement. DA concentrations aligned to the initiation of lever pressing (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S6A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6D</xref>) and stimulation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S6E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6H</xref>) were also not affected by violations of expectations during the transitions between FR requirements, as might be expected due to reward-prediction errors. Accumbal DA release has previously been found to encode economic information via distinct temporal dynamics rather than just the peak response (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hollon et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore also compared the area under the curve (AUC) across the entire 5-s cue and found similar results across FR epochs (one-way RM ANOVA: F<sub>(4 772)</sub> = 0.494 p = 0.74; data not shown). Since increasing response requirements did not extinguish ICSS responding (also see <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), we used a concurrent-choice paradigm to confirm that the imposed response requirement indeed reflected a comparatively less valued circumstance (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7A</xref>). Comparisons were made between FR1 and FR20, as behavioral decrements were only observed at this latter ratio. While mice continued to respond when the 20-press requirement was the only available option (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7B</xref>), they displayed a clear preference for the lower cost when given a choice (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S7C</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7D</xref>). Thus, cue- and stimulation-evoked NAc DA release does not necessarily track an expected or experienced decrease in the perceived utility of DA-neuron-mediated reinforcement due to an increase in the effortful (lever presses per reinforcer) or temporal (time to earn stimulation) cost. Moreover, cue-evoked NAc DA release does not predict the latency to respond for a learned action under these specific experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>DA Release and Expected Magnitude of DA Neuron Activation</title><p id="P13">Stable cue-evoked DA release across increasing response costs could arise because there was no change in reinforcer-evoked dopaminergic activity that could be transferred to the cue, as demonstrated by the stable stimulus-evoked increase in NAc DA release. Notably, several studies indicate that phasically increasing or decreasing reward-evoked DA neuron activity modifies cue-evoked behavior (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore assessed whether the cue-evoked signal reflects the expected magnitude of dopaminergic activity by manipulating the duration of VTA DA neuron stimulation earned on an FR1-VTO schedule (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Eliminating reinforcement (0-s duration), but not increasing stimulation duration (2 s), affected behavior by decreasing active lever pressing (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) and increasing latency to respond (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), inactive lever pressing (F<sub>(3</sub>,<sub>24)</sub> = 4.0, p = 0.019), and trial omissions (F<sub>(3</sub>,<sub>24)</sub> = 13.01, p &#x0003c; 0.001). DA concentration changes from a representative session are plotted relative to cue-onset and across consecutive trials in <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>. Despite greater DA release during the 2-s stimulation, cue-evoked DA release was only affected by elimination of reinforcement (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). We also found comparable results when analyzing the AUC during the cue (one-way RM ANOVA: F<sub>(3</sub>,<sub>988)</sub> = 20.27 p &#x0003c; 0.001; all p &#x0003c; 0.001, 0 s versus all other stimulation epochs; data not shown). Stimulation-evoked DA release remained stable within each stimulation epoch (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8A</xref>), and cue-evoked DA release slowly declined but quickly returned to baseline following the elimination and reintroduction of the reinforcer, respectively (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8B</xref>). The conditioned DA release event declined across trials when stimulation was withheld (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8B</xref>) at a rate that is strikingly similar to that seen during extinction of cocaine reinforcement (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Stuber et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, mice did not display a preference for the 1-s or 2-s stimulation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S7E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7G</xref>). Thus, we specifically isolated a direct comparison between the amount of reinforcer-evoked and cue-evoked DA release that cannot be explained by distinct effects on behavior. Our findings indicate that DA release and behavior track the availability, but not the expected magnitude, of DA neuron activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S7"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec id="S8"><title>Accumbal DA Release Tracks DA-Neuron-Mediated Reinforcement</title><p id="P14">VTA to NAc DA transmission allows reward-predictive cues to promote appetitive behavioral responses. This is evidenced by pharmacological (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Nicola et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Wyvell and Berridge, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">Yun et al., 2004</xref>), lesion (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Parkinson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Taylor and Robbins, 1986</xref>), and optogenetic (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Sharpe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>) studies demonstrating that increasing or decreasing VTA activity or DA signaling in the NAc increases or decreases cue-motivated reward seeking. But what information about reward is relayed to the cue remains an open question. Neural recordings of DA function indicate that phasic activation of DA neurons operates as a teaching signal that encodes reward prediction errors (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Hart et al., 2014</xref>) or the difference between actual and expected outcomes. As rewards become increasingly expected, the DA response to the reward and cue progressively decreases and increases, respectively, and the transfer of this signal from reward to cue conforms to temporal-difference reinforcement learning models (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Montague et al., 1996</xref>). Violations of expectations, such as a change in the magnitude or probability of reward, are reflected in reward- and cue-evoked DA signals (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beyene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Fiorillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>). By encoding economic parameters of predicted rewards in their activity patterns, DA neurons are thought to ascribe incentive-motivational value to reward-predicting cues, allowing them to direct and invigorate reward pursuit (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">McClure et al., 2003</xref>). In line with this hypothesis, cues predicting access to forthcoming food (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Roitman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Syed et al., 2016</xref>), cocaine (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2003</xref>), or brain stimulation reward (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beyene et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Oleson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Owesson-White et al., 2008</xref>) elicit transient elevations in NAc DA release that accompany action initiation. However, the precise type of information that is transferred by DA neuron activation to antecedent cues has been unclear.</p><p id="P15">Here, we found that during optogenetic ICSS, DA release gradually increased in response to the cue while DA release evoked by the stimulation declined as learning progressed (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, phasic optogenetic activation of DA neurons reinforces behavior and confers cues with the ability to predict future reinforcement and elicit NAc DA release. The decline in reinforcer-evoked DA release as it becomes increasingly expected (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">3I</xref>) conforms with the role of DA neurons in encoding reward-prediction errors. However, this finding is somewhat surprising given that the reinforcer in this context was direct DA neuron depolarization and sufficient time was allotted between stimulations to maintain a consistent signal (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). This effect has been reported previously in FSCV studies using electrical ICSS (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Oleson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Owesson-White et al., 2008</xref>) and is proposed to arise from the increased cue-evoked DA signal removing potential DA content from a restricted releasable pool. However, this explanation is not supported by our findings. Stimulated DA release was not altered by greater time between the cue and stimulation (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) and predictably increased according to stimulus duration, despite consistent cue-evoked DA release preceding the stimulation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), and did not differ if it was preceded by cue-evoked DA release (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S6E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6H</xref>). One explanation is that the stimulation-evoked DA signal declines to a stable level as the outcome becomes increasingly expected. In support of this notion, during the FR1-VTO task (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), the stimulation-evoked signal declines as learning occurs and the behavioral task remains constant but is not altered when action-outcome contingencies are changing (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Although phasic DA neuron activation allows cues to predict future reinforcement and elicit NAc DA release, changes in the magnitude or cost of DA neuron activation are not reflected in the cue-evoked DA response (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Because greater reward-evoked DA neuron activity is associated with a subsequently greater cue-evoked DA response (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>) and causes new learning about predictive cues (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>), we predicted that an increase in the duration of DA neuron activation and, in turn, the amount of DA released in the NAc would transfer to the cue. However, the cue-evoked DA signal was only affected by elimination of reinforcement (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Insensitivity to the larger stimulation may be due to its equivalent reinforcing capacity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S7E</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7G</xref>). However, the cue-evoked signal was also insensitive to an increase in effortful demand and delay to reinforcement, which was sufficient to hinder appetitive responding (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C</xref>, and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7D</xref>). If cue-evoked release was relatively greater for certain conditions, an increase in signal would have been detected, as demonstrated by the relatively larger DA signal evoked by stimulation on each trial. Thus, it is not necessarily the expected utility of DA neuron activation but its imminent occurrence that modifies cue-evoked DA release during ICSS. One possibility is that this lack of value-associated change in DA function during ICSS arises from the absence of external sensory input or physiological need (e.g., during food reinforcement), which likely recruits additional neural mechanisms that sculpt DA neurotransmission and behavior. However, our findings that cue-evoked DA release is insensitive to effort-based cost is generally in line with DA recordings during food or liquid reinforcement, as recently reviewed (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Walton and Bouret, 2019</xref>). Prior FSCV measures show that cue-evoked DA release does not reflect forthcoming cost (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Wanat et al., 2010</xref>), decreases strictly when the high-cost choice is the only available option (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Day et al., 2010</xref>), increases only in response to an unexpected reduction in cost (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Gan et al., 2010</xref>), or preferentially encodes reward size irrespective of cost (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hollon et al., 2014</xref>). It should be noted, however, that recent work has found effortful cost encoding by accumbal DA release using a behavioral economics paradigm (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Schelp et al., 2017</xref>), highlighting that additional work is needed to understand the precise relationship between effort and phasic DA. Furthermore, electrophysiology recordings generally agree with FSCV measures, demonstrating that phasic DA neuron firing to predictive cues preferentially reflects expected reward size, delay, and probability (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Eshel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Fiorillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Pasquereau and Turner, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>) rather than expected effortful cost (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Pasquereau and Turner, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Association between Terminal DA Release and Cell Body Activation</title><p id="P17">ICSS is used to understand the minimal neural elements of reinforcement by identifying the neuronal targets and activity patterns that are sufficient to drive appetitive behavior (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Olds and Milner, 1954</xref>). The precise role of mesolimbic DA signaling in brain reinforcement mechanisms has long been debated based on ICSS studies using electricity to activate neuronal targets. Pharmacological and anatomical assessments have generally implicated the mesolimbic DA system as a critical neural substrate mediating ICSS of midbrain regions. For instance, self-stimulation response rates are proportional to the density of dopaminergic neurons surrounding the electrode tip (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Corbett and Wise, 1980</xref>), and DA receptor antagonists (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Mogenson et al., 1979</xref>) or lesions of dopaminergic projections (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Fibiger et al., 1987</xref>) in the NAc reduce ICSS performance. Alternatively, psychometric measures indicate that small, myelinated fibers rather than large, unmyelinated DA axons are the principal targets of typical electrical ICSS parameters (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Bielajew and Shizgal, 1986</xref>; <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">Yeomans et al., 1988</xref>). Moreover, early FSCV measures indicated that NAc DA release does not occur during ongoing ICSS (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Garris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Kilpatrick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Kruk et al., 1998</xref>). These findings led to the conclusion that NAc DA release may be important for signaling the presence or predictability of rewards but is dissociable from ongoing reinforcement.</p><p id="P18">However, recent optogenetic manipulations confirm that VTA DA neuron activation is sufficient to sustain reinforcement (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ilango et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Witten et al., 2011</xref>), which is suppressed by infusing DA receptor antagonists into the NAc (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Steinberg et al., 2014</xref>). As is generally the case in optogenetic experiments, whether terminal neurotransmitter release accompanies behavior driven by neuronal activation was not known. It is feasible that NAc DA release may simply accompany the acquisition or initiation of ICSS and thereafter facilitate motor patterns required for continued responding. Furthermore, based on the estimated rate at which releasable DA pools replenish and autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of DA release operates (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Kita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Montague et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Yavich and MacDonald, 2000</xref>), along with rapid terminal DA reuptake, which should further increase during periods of repeated depolarization (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Calipari et al., 2017</xref>), it is reasonable to expect that DA concentrations in the NAc become dissociated from robust neuronal activation during ICSS. However, we find that although DA release time-locked to each stimulation declines during ongoing ICSS, it is apparent throughout the session and tightly associates with behavior (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>, and<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). Notably, alternative neural monitoring techniques, such as fluorescent calcium imaging, may not detect changes in neurotransmitter release if releasable pools are depleted and the association between vesicular release and intracellular calcium signaling fluctuates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P19">By monitoring DA release during ICSS, we characterized a dynamic association between optogenetic manipulations at cell bodies and terminal neurotransmitter release. Stimulation-evoked NAc DA release inversely tracked the reinforcing capacity of ICSS, such that more frequent stimulations (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) or a reduced latency to respond (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) corresponded with less DA release. Moreover, DA released to cues predicting access to self-stimulation increased as the latency to respond decreased (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), but cue-evoked DA release did not change according to the cost (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) or magnitude (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) of DA neuron activation. Hence, additional work is required to identify neural mechanisms that drive value-based changes in cue-evoked DA signaling. The ability of optogenetic ICSS to elicit learning and conditioned NAc DA release conforms with prior hypotheses related to the mechanisms by which addictive drugs hijack reward circuits (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Covey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Hyman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Keiflin and Janak, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Redish, 2004</xref>). Similar to optogenetic stimulation, addictive drugs bypass normal sensory processes to directly activate DA neurons. We show here that this action is sufficient to reinforce behavior, drive learning, and promote dopaminergic encoding of antecedent cues.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>STAR&#x022c6;METHODS</title><sec id="S12"><title>CONTACT FOR REAGENT AND RESOURCE SHARING</title><p id="P20">Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the Lead Contact, Joseph F.

Importantly, active presses did not differ between the two levers on session 3 (mean: 1,032.86 &#x000b1; 198.45) versus session 5 (mean: 1,154.00 &#x000b1; 211.91; paired t test; <italic>t</italic><sub>(6)</sub> = &#x02212;.060, p = 0.569). Mice then completed two sessions of concurrent choice tasks for 1 s versus 2 s stimulations and for FR1 versus FR20 response requirements. Each session consisted of three, 20-minute blocks. The first two blocks were forced choice trials, during which a single cue light was illuminated above a single extended lever, followed by a free choice block during which both cue lights and levers were presented on each trial. The stimulus duration and response ratio were randomly assigned to the left or right lever for each session, and lever assignment remained constant for each mouse across the entire session. During each block, the first lever press on a trial was followed by retraction of both levers, and completion of the response requirement resulted in immediate delivery of optical stimulation and dimming of the cue lights for the duration of stimulation. Thus, once mice chose the FR20 option, they were committed to this decision.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S19"><title>FSCV Analysis</title><p id="P26">FSCV was used to monitor DA concentration changes by applying a triangular waveform (&#x02212;0.4 V to +1.3V at 400 V/s) at 10 Hz to implanted carbon fiber microelectrodes.

Here, we report all FSCV measures in current (nA) as this is the unit of measurement that serves as an estimate of the change in concentration.
