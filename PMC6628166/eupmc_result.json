    "Cyanobacteria have cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs), which are photoreceptors that bind to a linear tetrapyrrole chromophore and sense UV-to-visible light. A recent study revealed that the dual-Cys CBCR AM1_1186g2 covalently attaches to phycocyanobilin and exhibits unique photoconversion between a Pr form (red-absorbing dark state, 位max = 641 nm) and Pb form (blue-absorbing photoproduct, 位max = 416 nm). This wavelength separation is larger than those of the other CBCRs, which is advantageous for optical tools. Nowadays, bioimaging and optogenetics technologies are powerful tools for biological research. In particular, the utilization of far-red and near-infrared light sources is required for noninvasive applications to mammals because of their high potential to penetrate into deep tissues. Biliverdin (BV) is an intrinsic chromophore and absorbs the longest wavelength among natural linear tetrapyrrole chromophores. Although the BV-binding photoreceptors are promising platforms for developing optical tools, AM1_1186g2 cannot efficiently attach BV. Herein, by rationally introducing several replacements, we developed a BV-binding AM1_1186g2 variant, KCAP_QV, that exhibited reversible photoconversion between a Pfr form (far-red-absorbing dark state, 位max = 691 nm) and Pb form (位max = 398 nm). This wavelength separation reached 293 nm, which is the largest among the known phytochrome and CBCR photoreceptors. In conclusion, the KCAP_QV molecule developed in this study can offer an alternative platform for the development of unique optical tools."
