    "The use of spatial light modulators to project computer generated holograms is a common strategy for optogenetic stimulation of multiple structures of interest within a three-dimensional volume. A common requirement when addressing multiple targets sparsely distributed in three dimensions is the generation of a points cloud, focusing excitation light in multiple diffraction-limited locations throughout the sample. Calculation of this type of holograms is most commonly performed with either the high-speed, low-performance random superposition algorithm, or the low-speed, high performance Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm. This paper presents a variation of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm that, by only performing iterations on a subset of the data, according to compressive sensing principles, is rendered significantly faster while maintaining high quality outputs. The algorithm is presented in high-efficiency and high-uniformity variants. All source code for the method implementation is available as Supplementary Materials and as open-source software. The method was tested computationally against existing algorithms, and the results were confirmed experimentally on a custom setup for in-vivo multiphoton optogenetics. The results clearly show that the proposed method can achieve computational speed performances close to the random superposition algorithm, while retaining the high performance of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, with a minimal hologram quality loss."
