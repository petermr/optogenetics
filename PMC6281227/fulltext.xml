To test the hypothesis that the loss of vision changes the perceptual threshold in the somatosensory system, we applied optogenetics to directly manipulate the afferent inputs involved in the whisker-barrel system using a transgenic rat (W-TChR2V4) that expresses channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) selectively in the large mechanoreceptive neurons in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and their peripheral nerve terminals. The licking behavior of W-TChR2V4 rat was conditioned to a blue LED light cue on the whisker area while the magnitude and duration of light pulses were varied. The perceptual threshold was thus quantitatively determined for each rat according to the relationship between the magnitude/duration of light and the reaction time between the LED light cue and the first licking event after it. We found that the perceptual threshold was more significantly reduced than the control non-deprived rats when the rats were visually deprived at postnatal 26&#x02013;30 days (P26-30, early VD group), but not at P58-66 (late VD group). However, the sensory threshold of a late VD animal was similar to that of a control. Our results suggest the presence of cross-modal plasticity by which the loss of vision at the juvenile period increased the sensitivity of the somatosensory system involved in the touch of whiskers.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17J06669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abe</surname><given-names>Kenta</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25250001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4299-3288</contrib-id><name><surname>Yawo</surname><given-names>Hiromu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H01413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4299-3288</contrib-id><name><surname>Yawo</surname><given-names>Hiromu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25115701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4299-3288</contrib-id><name><surname>Yawo</surname><given-names>Hiromu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic International Collaborative Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4299-3288</contrib-id><name><surname>Yawo</surname><given-names>Hiromu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Platform of Advanced Animal Model Support</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (No. 17J06669 to KA), a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 25250001 to HY), Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research (No. 15H01413 to HY), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas &#x0201c;Adaptive Circuit Shift&#x0201d; (No. 25115701 to HY) and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas &#x0201c;Platform of Advanced Animal Model Support&#x0201d; (to HY) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/grants01.html">http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/grants01.html</ext-link>, JST, Strategic International Collaborative Research Program, SICORP (to HY): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jst.go.jp/inter/english/sicorp/index.html">http://www.jst.go.jp/inter/english/sicorp/index.html</ext-link>.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Loss of one type of sensory modality can cause perceptual improvement of other sensory modalities. This process is called cross-modal plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, blind individuals compensate their lack of visual inputs by responding to somatosensory or auditory inputs with improved sensitivity and accuracy of perception. The brain can adapt to sensory deprivation in one modality by increasing plasticity and retuning neuronal circuits in other remaining modalities. Therefore, cross-modal plasticity of different sensory systems may require a coordinated shift of attention from the deprived to the intact sense [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The perceptual threshold is the weakest stimulus that an animal can detect and create perception, and should be under the regulation of neural computation in the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, the loss of one modality may affect the threshold in the others. For example, the rodent vibrissae sensory system has been one of the well-documented research models to investigate the effects of visual deprivation (VD) on the somatosensory perception [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, when the rat was visually deprived at birth, it performed the maze task, which is dependent on the tactile sense using whiskers, better than the non-deprived ones [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The reaction time is a useful parameter to evaluate the decision making, which is dependent on the strength and duration of the stimulus. When the stimulus strength is large, the reaction time becomes small, and <italic>vice versa</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These data indicate that the reaction time should be useful to estimate the perceptual threshold. However, there remain technical difficulties in animal models of controlling the pattern and magnitude of whisker inputs quantitatively to measure the reaction time precisely.</p><p>To overcome this, we used optogenetics to make afferent inputs involved in the whisker-barrel system directly by light. Previously, we generated a transgenic line of rat, W-TChR2V4, that expresses channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in the large mechanoreceptive neurons but not in the nociceptive ones in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As the whisker follicles are densely innervated by ChR2-positive mechanoreceptive nerve endings, the irradiation with blue light evoked electrical and fMRI responses in the barrel field of the contralateral somatosensory cortex [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Using this rat model, we recently demonstrated that optogenetic stimulation of the whisker area is a robust cue for decision making under head-fixed conditioning tasks [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, the behavioral outputs should be quantitatively measured while controlling the sensory inputs precisely by light. We found that the perceptual threshold was significantly reduced when the rats were visually deprived at postnatal 4 weeks (P26-30), but not at later (P58-66). It is suggested that the sensitivity to somatosensory inputs would be changed by the loss of visual inputs in a manner dependent on the developmental stages of the animal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the animal experiment protocol approved by Tohoku University Committee for Animal Experiments and in accordance with the guidelines for Animal Experiments and Related Activities of Tohoku University as well as the guiding principles of the Physiological Society of Japan and the National institutes of health (NIH), USA.

In order to protect the underlying extraocular muscles from injury, care was taken so as not to cut the tissue too deeply.

After training that consisted of the Go task for 0.5 <italic>h</italic> with an inter-trial-interval (ITI) of 20 &#x000b1; 5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208089.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), a Go-task conditioning test was made with salient photostimulation (12.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for 50 ms). In all groups, every animal was successfully conditioned to lick the nozzle synchronously with the blue light cue after several training sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208089.g002">Fig 2D&#x02013;2F</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, the licking probability was increased after the LED stimulus cue with a short delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208089.g002">Fig 2G&#x02013;2I</xref>). When the reaction time was measured between the onset of the light cue and the first licking event, it distributed mostly less than 1 s in all groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0208089.g002">Fig 2J</xref>). Previously, the distribution of the reaction time was quantitatively represented by the time when the cumulative probability reached to 0.75 (the third quartile of reaction time distribution, <italic>RT</italic><sub>75</sub>) and the logarithmic reciprocal of this value, -log (<italic>RT</italic><sub>75</sub>), which we referred to &#x0201c;agility&#x0201d;, was shown to be a quantitative indication of the reaction speed of an animal [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The agility is positive when 75% of the cue trials were accompanied by the first licking events within 1 s and is negative thereafter. Indeed, we observed previously that the agility was almost negative throughout sessions of any rats in the wild-type and unpaired groups whereas it changed from negative to positive with the progress of the training sessions for the Go-task conditioning of W-TChR2V4 rats [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

In the present experiments, we used a light pulse with small <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub> (0.1&#x02013;1 ms) as a conditioning cue to measure the reaction time precisely. In the ChR2 expressing neuron, the light-evoked depolarization depends on some parameters such as the pulse duration, the light intensity and the membrane time constant. In this case, although <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub> was small, its standard <italic>I</italic><sub>p</sub> was large (2.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). In addition, we irradiated a wide area in the whisker-pad for the LED stimulus cue to activate many TG neurons at once. Further, the TG neuron&#x02019;s membrane time constant is fast: a 1 ms mechanical stimulation can evoke neural activity and reward-related behavior [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the light-evoked somatosensory perception can be formed even for a short time pulse. Less number of activated afferent inputs is also expected with the reduction of <italic>I</italic><sub>p</sub> or <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub>.</p><p>We revealed, for the first time, that the perceptual threshold was significantly reduced in the early VD group, indicating the presence of cross-modal plasticity by which the loss of vision increased the sensitivity of the somatosensory system involved in the touch of whiskers. Because the reaction time between the blue LED cue and the first lick was dependent on the intensity and duration of the stimulation pulse, it should be an indication of how the stimulus strength affects the decision making [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The distributional change of the reaction time for a 0.5 <italic>h</italic>-session of the Go task was evaluated using a new parameter, referred to as &#x0201c;agility&#x0201d;, which was usually negative for animals unconditioned to the LED cue but became positive when conditioned [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, the agility was a function of both the power of light (<italic>I</italic><sub>p</sub>) and the duration (<italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub>) of the LED pulse. This enabled us to estimate the perceptual threshold as an <italic>I</italic><sub>p</sub> or a <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub> where the agility changed its sign from negative to positive. The perceptual threshold of early VD animals was significantly smaller than that of control or late VD animals during the near-threshold test 1 and 2, in which the <italic>I</italic><sub>p</sub> was changed with a fixed <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub>, as well as during test 4, in which the <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub> was changed with a fixed <italic>I</italic><sub>p</sub>. However, the perceptual threshold of late VD animals was similar to that of control animals. The cross-modal plasticity of the somatosensory system appeared to be dependent on the age of the loss of vision and the reduction of perceptual threshold could be manifest when it occurred early in the development. In test 3, no significant difference of the perceptual threshold was shown despite the same series of <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub> as test 4. It is possible that the whisker-tactile perception is not a simple function of <italic>I</italic><sub>p</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub>, but is dependent on the stimulus pattern. When the salient stimulus was given, the significant difference in the success rate and reaction time disappeared in each animal group, indicating that there was no change in the minimal reaction time (or the maximal agility).</p><p>The reaction time is more than the simple sum of the time spent for sensory input and motor output (sensory-guided behavior) and is regarded as a direct reflection of the time for decision [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and is affected by cognitive functions such as attention [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, there is no corresponding increase in the level of sensory inputs from the peripheral organs [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Cross-modal plasticity allows the same bottom up sensory inputs to more strongly influence the activity of the cortical neurons, and VD decreases the neural threshold for sound intensity in A1 L4 neurons [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and shapes the neuronal receptive fields in A1 [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and barrel [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>At the molecular/cellular level, the VD increases the extracellular serotonin in the barrel cortex and facilitates the synaptic delivery of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at L4-2/3 synapses in the barrel cortex of juvenile rats [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Additionally, transient strengthening of excitatory synapses at L4-2/3 in the barrel cortex could trigger an enhancement of the inhibitory inputs to the neighboring barrel, and sustained lateral inhibition can maintain the sharpening of whisker-barrel map [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The functional architecture of the adult neocortex is presumed to be organized by the excitatory-inhibitory balance [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Probably, VD is involved in this balance. Thus, this should also be observed when VD is initiated in adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the majority of these studies focused on the deprived cortex as the main substrate for functional and behavioral compensation that accompanies early sensory loss [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Being consistent with these studies, we did not find a significant difference between the late VD and control groups. Alternatively, the induction of VD-mediated cross-modal plasticity could be dependent on the developmental stages. On the other hand, it should be noted that the perceptual threshold varied depending on the intensity and duration in the LED stimulus cue. If we would change these parameters, we could find a significant difference between the late VD and the control. It is also possible that the perceptual threshold could be decreased by the increase of some topdown inputs into the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). For example, the optogenetic depolarization of apical dendrites facilitated the generation of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes in the later 5 pyramidal cells in the barrel cortex [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The topdown inputs to the superficial cortical layers would be thus amplified [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] with a reduced perceptual threshold in the S1 [<xref rid="pone.0208089.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These hypotheses are consistent with the notion that the barrel cortex of early VD rats would become more sensitive to the whisker inputs than the non-VD ones. However, it should be investigated whether the same mechanism could explain the difference between early and late VD animals. Other molecular and circuitry mechanisms could also be involved in the process of perceptual decision making and determine the reaction time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A numerical analysis using optogenetics enabled us to evaluate the perceptual threshold of whisker-tactile inputs quantitatively.
