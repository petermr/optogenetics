Fine-tuning the timing and expression levels of enzymes involved in both natural and engineered pathways can relieve bottlenecks and minimize the metabolic burden of chemical production<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. This is especially critical when the product of interest or its precursors are toxic, or when the biosynthetic pathway of interest competes with endogenous pathways that are essential for cell growth.</p><p id="P3">To address these challenges, metabolic engineers frequently use inducible systems to control metabolic enzyme expression<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> (see Supplementary Discussion). This approach makes it possible to separate bioreactor operation into two phases: a growth phase, during which product biosynthesis is repressed, and a production phase, when flux through the engineered pathway is maximized. Essential pathways that compete with product formation can be controlled with &#x0201c;metabolic valves&#x0201d;: genetic programs that express essential enzymes during the growth phase to build biomass, and repress them during the production phase to redirect metabolism towards desired products<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P4">Light is an attractive strategy to control gene expression in yeast for metabolic engineering applications. It is inexpensive and compatible with any carbon source or nutrient composition. Furthermore, light can be applied or removed instantaneously; this precise control over the level or duration of enzyme expression could simplify the screening of optimal metabolic pathway enzyme proportions and enable new time-varying modes of control<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. In recent years, light-switchable transcription modules have been shown to enable non-toxic, tunable gene expression in a variety of organisms<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, including yeast<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. We thus sought to test whether optogenetics could be used to control rewired cellular metabolisms to overproduce valuable chemicals.</p><p id="P5">Here, we describe two powerful optogenetic gene expression systems for yeast, <italic>OptoEXP</italic> and <italic>OptoINVRT</italic>, based on the blue light-activated EL222 eukaryotic gene expression system<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. Using these systems, we show that it is possible to strongly activate and repress distinct sets of genes in a light-dependent manner. We apply our approach to control endogenous and engineered metabolic pathways to define the growth and production phases of fermentation, enabling production of three valuable chemicals (lactate or isobutanol and 2-methyl-1-butanol) whose biosyntheses directly compete with ethanol production. Using a time-varying illumination schedule, we achieve titers of 8.49 &#x000b1; 0.31 g/L of isobutanol and 2.38 &#x000b1; 0.06 g/L of 2-methyl-1-butanol (2-MBOH). Our results thus reveal that a simple technology &#x02013; bidirectional light-controlled enzyme expression &#x02013; offers a rich set of tools for metabolic engineering.</p><p id="P6">Our first goal was to construct bidirectional gene circuits in yeast to either induce or repress genes of interest with light. We used the EL222 optogenetic transcription system, which consists of a light-sensitive transcription factor from <italic>Erythrobacter litoralis</italic> (EL222) and its corresponding promoter, P<sub>C120</sub>, to drive expression of a gene of interest (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. The EL222 system is a robust and versatile gene expression platform, previously applied in <italic>E. coli</italic>, mammalian cells, and zebrafish<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. We first constructed a yeast strain, YEZ139, in which expression of VP16-EL222 was driven by the strong constitutive P<sub>PGK1</sub> promoter (P<sub>PGK1</sub>-VP16-EL222) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was driven by the P<sub>C120</sub> promoter (P<sub>C120</sub>-GFP; see Methods, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1</xref>). We called this system (and variants with different promoters driving EL222) <italic>OptoEXP</italic>.</p><p id="P7"><italic>OptoEXP</italic> enables strong and titratable light-inducible gene expression. In both glucose and glycerol media, cells with <italic>OptoEXP</italic> controlling GFP expression show a 43-fold increase in GFP expression when exposed to constant light compared to dark-incubated cells, while intermittent light pulses produce intermediate expression levels (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 2</xref>). We tested that all light sources used were sufficiently bright to maximally activate the EL222 system; thus, varying duty cycle was a reliable and reproducible method for achieving intermediate gene expression output (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 3</xref>, Online Methods). The maximum activation levels of <italic>OptoEXP</italic> are comparable to those reached by the <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter (P<sub>ADH1</sub>), a constitutive promoter commonly used in metabolic engineering (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p id="P8">To construct a light-repressible gene circuit, we inverted the response of the <italic>OptoEXP</italic> system in a manner akin to the NOT logical gate used in digital processes. We harnessed the yeast galactose (GAL) regulon<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, in which Gal80p binds to and inhibits the Gal4p transcription factor, blocking its ability to induce expression from the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (P<sub>GAL1</sub>). We reasoned that engineering yeast cells with constitutive <italic>GAL4</italic> and EL222-regulated <italic>GAL80</italic> would lead to constitutive expression from the P<sub>GAL1</sub> promoter in the dark and repression of P<sub>GAL1</sub> in the light (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref>).</p><p id="P9">Starting from a strain in which both <italic>GAL80</italic> and <italic>GAL4</italic> are deleted, YEZ44, we constructed three expressed variants of this core inverter topology, which we termed <italic>OptoINVRT1-3</italic> (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>). These variants differed in the strength of the promoter driving <italic>GAL4</italic> and the fusion of a photosensitive degron domain<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> to the C-terminus of Gal4p to induce faster and more complete light-dependent repression (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4a, b</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Using P<sub>GAL1</sub>-GFP as a reporter, we found that all three <italic>OptoINVRT</italic> circuits exhibit robust light-induced gene repression (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). <italic>OptoINVRT2</italic> has the highest maximum expression in the dark (almost 85% of P<sub>TEF1</sub> levels), while <italic>OptoINVRT3</italic> has the highest fold of repression (more than 70-fold) and lowest expression in full-light. All three <italic>OptoINVRT</italic> circuits show similar responses in a second yeast strain, Y202, that is relevant for metabolic engineering due to its deletion of all three pyruvate decarboxylase genes (S288C, <italic>gal80-&#x00394; pdc1-&#x00394;, pdc5-&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>pdc6-&#x00394;</italic>; <xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Our results thus demonstrate that the <italic>OptoINVRT</italic> platform can achieve a wide range of expression levels, light sensitivities, and fold-change responses in different strain backgrounds for flexible incorporation in diverse metabolic engineering applications.</p><p id="P10">To reduce ethanol byproduct formation, while still allowing cell growth on glucose, we used <italic>OptoEXP</italic> to control pyruvate decarboxylation (PDC), an essential step in ethanol biosynthesis. Completely removing PDC activity in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (by deleting <italic>PDC1</italic>, <italic>PDC5</italic> and <italic>PDC6</italic>) does not suffice, because the triple deletion renders yeast unable to grow on glucose due to the essential role of these genes in NAD<sup>+</sup> recycling for glycolysis<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, as well as a lack of effective alternatives for ATP generation due to glucose-mediated repression of respiration<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. Thus, we used our <italic>OptoEXP</italic> circuit to build a light-dependent metabolic valve for <italic>PDC1</italic> expression (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Light stimulation &#x0201c;opens&#x0201d; the valve, enabling robust cell growth and ethanol production; dark incubation &#x0201c;closes&#x0201d; the valve to limit the metabolism of pyruvate into ethanol, thereby inhibiting cell growth on glucose, and enhancing the biosynthesis of alternative pyruvate-derived products.</p><p id="P11">A strain with all <italic>PDC</italic> genes deleted and with <italic>OptoEXP</italic> driving <italic>PDC1</italic> expression, YEZ61-23 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), exhibits light-dependent growth on glucose. YEZ61-23 grows on glycerol/ethanol (YPGE) independently of light because PDC is dispensable for respiration. However, it is only able to grow on glucose plates (YPD) in the presence of blue light (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), with its growth rate in liquid media reaching 91.9 &#x000b1; 4.9% of the wild type (BY4741) at full light (<xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c and d</xref>). Significant growth is achieved even at low light doses (43.7 &#x000b1; 2.7% of wild-type growth rate with only 12.5% light duty cycle), suggesting that light-dependent growth may be achieved at cell densities relevant for metabolic engineering applications.</p><p id="P12">We then tested whether the bidirectional control afforded by combining our <italic>OptoEXP</italic> and <italic>OptoINVRT</italic> circuits could be used to drive two phases of cellular metabolism &#x02013; a growth phase with mainly ethanol fermentation, and a production phase where carbon instead accumulates as a desired valuable product: either lactate or isobutanol. Production of both lactate and isobutanol compete directly with ethanol production as distinct enzymes modify pyruvate to produce each product (ethanol: Pdc1p; lactate: LDH; isobutanol: Ilv2p and subsequent enzymes) (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5a</xref>). We reasoned that by controlling the expression of <italic>PDC1</italic> with <italic>OptoEXP</italic> and LDH/<italic>ILV2</italic> with <italic>OptoINVRT</italic>, moving cells from light to dark would shift the metabolism from ethanol to lactate/isobutanol production (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5b</xref>).</p><p id="P13">We first tested our strategy in the simpler case of lactate biosynthesis, which requires overexpression of only one enzyme (LDH) and whose presence in the media is well-tolerated by yeast. We integrated multiple copies of P<sub>GAL1</sub>-LDH and P<sub>C120</sub>-<italic>PDC1</italic> into our Y202 <italic>OptoINVRT</italic> strains (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>) and observed a pronounced increase in lactate biosynthesis upon a shift from dark to light, consistent with light-dependent changes in <italic>PDC1</italic> and LDH expression levels (see Methods, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4c</xref>, <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Based on these promising results, we next tested our optogenetic circuits on the more complex biosynthesis of isobutanol (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, b</xref>), an advanced biofuel, with much higher toxicity than lactate. Our approach was to optogenetically control only the first enzyme in the isobutanol pathway, acetolactate synthase (encoded by <italic>ILV2</italic>), reasoning that if subsequent enzymes were constitutively expressed, overall pathway flux would still be light-controlled.</p><p id="P14">We transformed Y202 with <italic>OptoEXP</italic>, each one of the <italic>OptoINVRT</italic> circuits, multiple copies of P<sub>GAL1</sub>-<italic>ILV2</italic> and P<sub>C120</sub>-<italic>PDC1</italic> and the rest of the mitochondrial isobutanol biosynthetic pathway under strong constitutive promoters<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, producing YEZ159, YEZ156, and, HPY6 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Tables 1 and 2</xref>, see Methods). We found that colonies from YEZ159, containing <italic>OptoINVRT1</italic>, produced the highest isobutanol titers from 4% glucose (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 4d, e</xref>). To further enhance isobutanol production, we deleted the mitochondrial branched chain amino acid aminotransferase, <italic>BAT1</italic>, which competes for the &#x003b1;-ketoisovalerate precursor<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>, resulting in strain YEZ167-4 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). YEZ167-4 contains six copies of P<sub>C120</sub>-<italic>PDC1</italic> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6a</xref>), leading to fast cell growth under full light.</p><p id="P15">Varying the cell density at which cultures are switched from dark to light and the incubation time in the dark before starting the fermentation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 5c</xref>), we found that YEZ167-4 can produce as much as 735 &#x000b1; 15 mg/L of isobutanol from 2 % glucose over 48 h (a yield of 34.2 &#x000b1; 0.7 mg isobutanol/g glucose, <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 7</xref>). Switching to 15% glucose and 80 hour-long fermentations increases production to only 1.22 &#x000b1; 0.11 g/L of isobutanol (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). However, under these conditions YEZ167-4 is unable to consume all the glucose in the medium (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8a</xref>), indicating a stalled fermentation in which cells have undergone premature metabolic arrest.</p><p id="P16">We hypothesized that during prolonged dark incubation, Pdc1p becomes limiting to a point where cellular metabolism arrests due to NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion. We reasoned that periodic pulses of light during the production phase of fermentation could transiently induce <italic>PDC1</italic> expression, thus increasing NAD<sup>+</sup> pools and restoring cellular metabolism, glucose consumption, and isobutanol production. We tested different light schedules, applying periodic illumination bouts (30 minutes of blue light at a duty cycle of 15s/65s) once every 5, 10, or 20 hours throughout the 80-hour-long production phase of the fermentation. When cells are exposed to one light bout every 10 hours, isobutanol production nearly triples to 3.37 &#x000b1; 0.17 g/L (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), and 2-MBOH, another desirable advanced biofuel co-produced with the mitochondrial isobutanol pathway<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, is produced at 433 &#x000b1; 69 mg/L. These isobutanol yields are more than 2.5 times higher than if cells are kept in the dark throughout the production phase of the fermentation, and 4 times higher than YZy335, a strain that contains the entire isobutanol pathway and <italic>BAT1</italic> deletion but lacks light-inducible metabolic control. We directly confirmed that our light pulses partially replenish the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolite pool under these fermentation conditions (see Methods; <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 8b</xref>).</p><p id="P17">To determine the applicability of optogenetics to metabolic engineering in lab-scale bioreactors, we measured the growth of the <italic>OptoEXP</italic>-driven <italic>PDC1</italic> strain, YEZ167-4, in a 2-L fermentor with 15% glucose and constant blue light (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9a, b</xref>). Under these conditions, YEZ167-4 is able to reach the same optical density (OD<sub>600</sub> = 17.1) as a light-independent, PDC<sup>+</sup> strain, YZy335 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), indicating that light penetration into the bioreactor is sufficient to drive robust <italic>PDC1</italic> expression and growth (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). We then measured isobutanol and 2-MBOH production in fed-batch 0.5 L bioreactors under microaerobic conditions and pH control (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 9c, d</xref>). We used constant illumination to build YEZ167-4 biomass during a batch growth phase, and then switched to a fed-batch production phase with periodic bouts of light to maintain sufficient NAD<sup>+</sup> levels to preserve metabolic activity. This fermentation strategy yielded 8.49 &#x000b1; 0.31 g/L of isobutanol and 2.38 &#x000b1; .06 g/L of 2-MBOH, with post-induction average yields of 53.5 &#x000b1; 8.4 mg/g-glucose for isobutanol (13% of theoretical maximum) and 14.17 &#x000b1; 2.57 mg/g-glucose of 2-MBOH, with measured instantaneous isobutanol yields of up to 270.6 mg/g (66% theoretical yield) (<xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 5, see Methods and Supplementary Results</xref>). Our mechanistic predictions of a darkness-induced metabolic shift to isobutanol biosynthesis is supported by qPCR measurements of <italic>PDC1</italic> and <italic>ILV2</italic> mRNA levels (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 6b</xref>).</p><p id="P18">Optogenetics is a powerful way to control cellular physiology.

Our work demonstrates that optogenetics also holds promise in metabolic engineering, enabling the reversible control and fine-tuning of engineered metabolic pathways.</p><p id="P19">Nevertheless, combining optogenetics and metabolic engineering has its challenges. The high cell densities usually associated with microbial fermentations might be predicted to severely limit light penetration, which is one reason we initially adopted our design of a darkness-induced production phase. However, additional experiments showed robust light-stimulated gene expression could be achieved even at cell densities as high as OD<sub>600</sub> = 50 in 5-L bioreactors (<xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 10</xref>), suggesting that the high light sensitivity and strong gene expression achieved by the current generation of optogenetic tools may be sufficient even in these challenging conditions. Even more potent responses to dim light could potentially be achieved by using well-characterized LOV mutants with longer lit-state lifetimes<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> (our current VP16-EL222 remains in the photoactivated state for ~30 sec<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>), or other photoactive proteins with highly stable light-switchable conformations<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> (see <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Discussion</xref>). For fermentation conditions that pose a greater challenge to light penetration than in this study, <italic>OptoINVRT</italic> circuits offer a solution to gene expression control as they do not require light during the fermentation.</p><p id="P20">We utilized optogenetic regulation of engineered metabolic pathways to address the long-standing challenge of ethanol competition in branched-chain alcohol production.
