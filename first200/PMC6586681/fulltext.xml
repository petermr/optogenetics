In pursuit behavior with a moving target, mice use distance to target to guide their own movement continuously. Here, we show that in the sensorimotor striatum, parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) can represent the distance between self and target during pursuit behavior, while striatal projection neurons (SPNs), which receive FSI projections, can represent self-velocity. FSIs are shown to regulate velocity-related SPN activity during pursuit, so that movement velocity is continuously modulated by distance to target. Moreover, bidirectional manipulation of FSI activity can selectively disrupt performance by increasing or decreasing the self-target distance. Our results reveal a key role of the FSI-SPN interneuron circuit in pursuit behavior and elucidate how this circuit implements distance to velocity transformation required for the critical underlying computation.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Many natural behaviours involve tracking of a target in space.

Yet the neural substrates of such pursuit behavior remain poorly understood. Technical limitations have prevented the study of natural pursuit behavior in freely moving animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In this study, we designed a new behavioral task, in which mice follow a continuously moving target that delivers sucrose reward. Using 3D motion capture, we were able to track not only the position of the mouse but also the distance to target, a crucial variable for accurate pursuit. This task allows us to compare continuous behavioral variables and neural activity recorded at the same time.</p><p id="Par4">We studied the contribution of the inhibitory interneuron circuit in the sensorimotor striatum to pursuit behavior. The striatum is a major basal ganglia (BG) nucleus that has been implicated in motor control, compulsive behavior, and habit formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. A critical circuit in the striatum is formed by the parvalbumin-positive GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) and striatal projection neurons (SPNs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. FSIs, which constitute &#x0003c;1% of the striatal neuronal population, receive glutamatergic inputs from the cerebral cortex and project to many SPNs, which make up over 90% of the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Reduced number of FSIs is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Tourette&#x02019;s syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Behavioral studies have also implicated the FSIs in choice behavior and habitual lever pressing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recent work has shown that sensorimotor SPN activity is often highly correlated with movement velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and optogenetic activation of SPNs alters movement velocity in a frequency-dependent fashion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Yet it remains unclear how, during target pursuit behavior, the striatal output is commanded by representation of distance to target. We hypothesize that the FSI&#x02013;SPN interneuron circuit plays a critical role in pursuit behavior, allowing cortical inputs representing the spatial relationship between self and target to reach the BG. In particular, the distance representation can be converted into instantaneous velocity commands during pursuit behavior. To test this hypothesis, we used wireless in vivo electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and cell-type-specific manipulation of neural activity to examine the contributions of the striatal microcircuit to pursuit behavior in freely moving mice. Our results established for the first time a key role of this local striatal circuit in pursuit behavior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Behavioral task</title><p id="Par6">We recorded head and target positions during pursuit behavior using motion capture at 100 frames per second (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). All mice rapidly learned to follow the moving target (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, Supplementary movie&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and showed comparable performance whether the target velocity is constant (16&#x02009;mm/s, leftward or rightward) or variable (5&#x02013;48&#x02009;mm/s). Because pursuit behavior is self-initiated in our task, we separated periods in which the mice followed the target and periods in which they did not. &#x02018;Following&#x02019; is defined as staying in a spatially defined zone close to the target for at least 800&#x02009;ms (&#x0003c;15&#x02009;mm <italic>&#x000d7;</italic>-axis, &#x0003c;10&#x02009;mm in <italic>y</italic>-axis, &#x0003c;20&#x02009;mm in <italic>z</italic>-axis), when the head is next to the sucrose spout. Otherwise, behavior is classified as &#x02018;not following&#x02019; (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b&#x02013;d</xref>; for variable velocity see Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). When the animal is not following, it could be engaged in any number of activities, such as grooming, orienting, rearing, and so on. A cross-correlation analysis suggests that mice use distance information to adjust their velocity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). With distance as the reference variable, a positive lag means that distance leads velocity, and that the distance representation is used to guide velocity. This is exactly what we found. This lag measure is also positively correlated with the distance, the key measure of pursuit performance: the worse the pursuit performance, the more self-velocity lags self-target distance, as expected if distance is used to adjust velocity.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Summary of behavioral results. <bold>a</bold> Top,&#x000a0;illustration of the pursuit task and location of the infrared cameras for 3D motion capture.

We classified FSIs and SPNs based on their different average firing rates and spike waveforms. We identified 362 putative SPNs in the dorsolateral striatum (trough to peak width: 570.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.3&#x02009;&#x000b5;s, firing rate: 2.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;Hz) and 91 FSIs (width: 173.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.9&#x02009;&#x000b5;s, firing rate: 20.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9&#x02009;Hz, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The proportion of FSIs is higher than expected from anatomical studies (1&#x02013;2%) because these neurons have much higher firing rates compared to SPNs.</p><p id="Par8">FSIs and SPNs showed distinct representations of behavioral variables: FSIs more commonly represented self-target distance (56% of recorded) whereas SPNs (32%) more commonly represented velocity (chi square&#x02009;=&#x02009;88.71, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, Supplementary Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, there are two distinct populations of SPNs: One population increases firing as leftward velocity increases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a&#x02013;c</xref>) and the other increases firing as rightward velocity increases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d&#x02013;f</xref>). When we analyzed the relationship between single unit activity and velocity from the entire session, the correlation coefficient. By comparison, correlation with other variables is much lower (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Using the population average activity as a measure of the ensemble activity, there is strong correlation between neural activity and velocity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). Overall, the relationship between neural activity and velocity can be described with a sigmoid function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>SPNs represent self-velocity when animal is following target. <bold>a</bold> A representative SPN with spike waveform.

With negative feedback control, the actual velocity achieved closely matches the command. Interestingly, the correlation with velocity is significantly reduced when the mice are not following, for both populations of velocity-correlated neurons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). This finding suggests that the relationship between velocity and SPN output is contingent upon self-initiated pursuit behavior.</p><p id="Par10">On the other hand, many FSIs showed continuous representation of target distance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Their firing rates varied monotonically with target distance. The representation of target distance is independent of target or self-movement direction (whether leftward or rightward). One group increases firing as left distance increases, and decreases firing as right distance increases (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a&#x02013;c</xref>), whereas a second group shows the opposite pattern (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d&#x02013;f</xref>). By comparison, the correlation with other variables is much lower (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). There is a strong linear relationship between the population activity of distance FSIs and distance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>). For both populations, the mean firing rate corresponds to roughly the &#x02018;straight ahead&#x02019; condition.

We hypothesize that these inputs can provide information on distance to target. Based on the anatomy of the FSI&#x02013;SPN circuit and our results, we propose a working model for how this circuit contributes to pursuit behavior (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). According to this model, the SPNs and FSIs that form a functional unit share excitatory cortical inputs. Signals representing target distance are sent via the corticostriatal projections to a subset of FSIs and SPNs. FSI output sends a slightly delayed of this signal to the relevant SPNs. Consequently, a given velocity SPN can receive two inputs, one net positive signal from the cortex that represents distance, and a slightly delayed version of the same input, with the sign inverted, from the FSI. Because the FSI&#x02013;SPN projection is inhibitory (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>), it is subtracted from the excitatory input, and the SPN output will then reflect the difference between excitatory cortical input and a temporally delayed version of the same signal. This &#x02018;temporal difference&#x02019; signal, similar to taking the time derivative of the distance representation, is then used as a velocity command to drive performance. At rest, velocity is close to zero, consistent with the typically low baseline firing rates of SPNs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. By contrast, FSIs are characterized by high tonic firing rates, which make them more suitable for signaling the distance variable. Tonic FSI firing close to the middle of the range is used to represent the effective zero, when the target is directly in front of the mouse. Different types of errors in distance control (left vs. right) are indicated by the sign of the signal relative to the effective zero (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. For neurons that increase firing when the target is to the left, the left extreme is represented by the highest firing rate and the right extreme is represented by the lowest firing rate, and vice versa for neurons that increase firing when target is on the right side. A positive error means that distance error has increased, i.e. the target is farther away in a particular direction, and velocity in that direction must be increased accordingly to reduce the distance error. Thus an increase in left distance increases the temporal difference signal computed by the FSI&#x02013;SPN circuit, and a corresponding increase in the leftward velocity command. A negative difference signal indicates that the distance error is decreasing and velocity in that direction should be reduced. SPN output is therefore regulated by the <italic>change</italic> in distance between self and target in real time.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Working model of how FSI&#x02013;SPN circuit contributes to continuous pursuit. <bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram of the FSI&#x02013;SPN feedforward inhibition circuit. Note that in the equation for velocity, distance refers to distance to target. This equation only applies to self-velocity during continuous pursuit. As shown here, excitatory cortical inputs reach both the FSI and SPN. In this case, some excitatory input represents distance to target, a key error signal used to guide pursuit behavior, and the FSI relays a slightly delayed version of the same signal to the SPN. Thus the delayed distance signal (Distance<sub><italic>t</italic>&#x02212;1</sub>) is subtracted from the distance signal (Distance<sub><italic>t</italic></sub>), and the SPN output reflects the difference between these two signals, i.e. the change in distance in this time step.

At any time, the target could be on either side of the mouse. We identified distinct types of self&#x02013;target distance representations in FSIs. Some neurons increase firing when the target moves to the left side of the animal, and decrease firing when it moves to the right, and vice versa for other neurons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). On the other hand, SPNs are strongly correlated with movement velocity, with clear direction-specificity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">In order to test whether FSIs are necessary for pursuit, we used a variety of methods to manipulate their activity. Silencing these neurons using hM4Di or TeLC resulted in impaired pursuit (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). However, as these techniques lacked temporal precision, it was only possible to measure overall distance and velocity during the session. It was not possible to assess the immediate impact of FSI silencing on behavior. Using optogenetics, we were able to obtain a better understanding of how bidirectional manipulation of FSI activity affected pursuit performance. In particular, inhibition using GtACR2 reduced distance while excitation using ChR2 increased distance. As expected, these manipulations have the opposite effects on velocity given the mainly inhibitory effects of FSIs on SPNs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). While these effects support the hypothesis that FSIs are critical for pursuit, it is unclear whether sensory detection in general was affected by manipulation of FSI activity. That is, we cannot easily rule out the possibility that FSIs are also critical for distance perception per se. The role of striatal FSIs in sensory processing remains to be elucidated.</p><p id="Par21">Recent studies have also elucidated neural substrates underlying natural prey pursuit in hunting behavior.

Different types of errors (left vs. right) are indicated by the sign of the signal in relation to the effective zero. For example, for neurons that increase firing when the target is to the left, the left extreme corresponds to the highest firing rate and the right extreme to the lowest firing rate, and vice versa for neurons that increase firing when the target is on the right side. These two types of FSIs may project to distinct types of SPNs that signal velocity. A distance error signaling &#x02018;too much to the left&#x02019; would suppress rightward neurons and activate leftward SPNs, whereas &#x02018;too much to the right&#x02019; would suppress leftward neurons and activate rightward SPNs. This organization would enable bidirectional control by FSIs.</p><p id="Par23">In our working model, we assume that the distance FSIs and velocity SPNs share cortical inputs, which represent distance to target. Yet the circuit computation generates instantaneous velocity commands from SPNs, because the feedforward FSI circuit allows differentiation of the distance variable during tracking. Previous optogenetic experiments showed that movement velocity depended on the frequency of striatonigral stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We also showed that inhibition of the direct pathway (D1+) neurons significantly reduced velocity during pursuit, but inhibition of indirect pathway (A2A+) neurons did not. Thus, the distance to velocity conversion is achieved mainly by the direct pathway. Previous work also showed that GABAergic output from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, the main output of the direct pathway, represents instantaneous position vector components<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Using the striatonigral pathway, velocity commands could be integrated into reference signals representing proprioceptive position references that change over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. These reference signals from the BG output would then reach downstream proprioceptive position control systems for posture and body configuration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Although velocity and distance are both continuous, time-varying variables, there are key differences between them. Movement velocity, detectable by mainly proprioceptive and vestibular sensory inputs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, is close to zero at rest. The usually low firing rates of SPNs are ideal for representing this type of variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. On the other hand, distance, usually detected by teloreceptive inputs, is rarely close to zero. FSIs are characterized by high tonic firing rates, which make them ideal for signaling distance. Presumably inputs from sensory cortical areas provide distance information that is sent to the striatal FSIs. Visual inputs are obviously critical, but we cannot rule out other sensory modalities. Based on our results, we hypothesize that representations of specific pursuit errors can activate the appropriate combination of direction-specific SPNs (e.g. moving leftward when the target is on the left side) and suppress the conflicting SPNs. With their strong inhibitory projections to SPNs, FSIs can suppress the activation of irrelevant or antagonistic SPNs via monosynaptic inhibition. On the other hand, via disinhibition or perhaps excitatory effects of GABA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, they can also have net excitatory effects on downstream SPNs.</p><p id="Par25">Given the importance of approaching a spatially discrete target in normal behavior, it is not surprising that striatal FSIs have been implicated in so many functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. For example, although reward is the eventual goal of behavior in our task, the striatal neurons we recorded represented specific spatial variables necessary for successful performance, rather than reward prediction or consumption. In accord with previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we found that, in the sensorimotor striatum at least, FSI and SPN activity is largely independent of reward delivery. Although some studies have suggested that striatal neurons are modulated by reward, they did not monitor continuous behavioral variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Standard manipulations like reward size or probability may also alter distance or velocity variables. It is also impossible to explain our results in terms of predicted reward value because FSI activity reflects distinct distance errors that are spatially defined, e.g. left and right. Extreme caution is therefore needed in interpreting experiments that lack precise and continuous behavioral measures. Abstract psychological concepts like reward value must be well anchored to clear experimental measures to generate interpretable results.</p><p id="Par26">Our results also resolve current controversies on the relationship between striatal activity and behavior. A recent study by Owen et al. concluded that FSIs are not needed for behavioral performance but for learning and plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. But they&#x000a0;did not use continuous behavioral measures and consequently failed to detect the crucial relationship between FSI activity and key performance variables like distance to target. In fact, because their learning tasks involved orienting and approaching reward targets, any learning defects observed following disruption of FSI output can be explained by performance deficits in approaching the target. Moreover, while some recent studies observed correlation between velocity and striatal output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, this conclusion has also been questioned. For example, Klaus et al. argued that SPNs can encode action identity independent of velocity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, but their conclusion is not supported by the data, because their accelerometer measures lack spatial resolution and their calcium imaging results lack temporal resolution. Thus, they were not able to measure&#x000a0;velocity vector components and quantify their relationship with neural activity.&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Moreover, free behavior in an open field is exceedingly complex and not always dependent on striatal output, so caution is also needed in interpreting neural activity recorded during such behavior.</p><p id="Par27">On the other hand, while classic studies discovered SPNs linked to movement speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, they did not measure behavior continuously in freely moving animals and relied on average measures. Kim et al. were the first to show that SPNs can represent vector components of velocity and to demonstrate that such representations are similar whether or not the behavioral outcome is rewarding or aversive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Just like a recent study using calcium imaging in head restrained mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, Kim et al. concluded that both SPNs and FSIs represented velocity. However, the video-based motion tracking used in their study did not have sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to dissociate the different contributions of SPNs and FSIs. In the present study the use of 3D motion capture reveals that, during tracking, FSIs more commonly represent distance to target, while many sensorimotor SPNs represent velocity.</p><p id="Par28">The velocity representation in a large proportion of sensorimotor SPNs is therefore unique, and so far not found in any other cell type except nigrostriatal dopamine neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Striatal velocity neurons have strong preference for direction of egocentric motion (left, right, up, down). Actual volitional movement is shaped by a combination of distinct vector components (at least four major classes depending on the direction of movement). A population of such&#x000a0;velocity-related neurons can therefore represent a velocity vector.</p><p id="Par29">In addition, although previous work found that SPNs are typically selective for contraversive movements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, we did not find more contraversive neurons than ipsiversive neurons. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, we might not have sampled enough neurons to obtain an accurate estimate of the distribution of contraversive and ipsiversive neurons. Secondly, the velocity-related SPNs recorded in this study might not be the same as those involved in spontaneous behavior in the absence of an explicit target. While these neuronal populations could overlap, additional neurons that receive bilateral projections from the cortex may be recruited for the pursuit task.</p><p id="Par30">A striking feature of our results is the high correlations between single unit activity and behavioral variables. High correlation is crucial if a signal like firing rate is used in analog computing, as is the case in our model. The concept of correlation is often misunderstood, in part because traditional studies have consistently failed to find high correlations between neural activity and behavior. Low correlation in most studies are responsible for the development of many elaborate statistical techniques and for conflicting interpretations of the neural code<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. For example, multiple regression is often used to analyze single unit data, and many argue that neural signals multiplex multiple behavioral variables, without explaining how to demultiplex the signals. In practice this allows one to argue that any neural signal can multiplex just about any collection of variables. Such a conclusion is hardly falsifiable. To observe the relationship between neural activity and behavior as reported here, it is critical to quantify behavior accurately and continuously in unrestrained animals, and to use measures with high temporal and spatial resolution. Our results suggest that low correlation between neural activity and behavior is due at least in part to limitations in behavioral measures, the widespread use of head restraint, and conventional experimental designs that rely exclusively on categorical classification of behaviors. In contrast, our working model, which involves simple analog computing, has the advantage of being parsimonious and falsifiable.</p><p id="Par31">In conclusion, while our results do not exclude other functional roles for striatal output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, they do demonstrate the role of sensorimotor SPNs in the control of velocity during continuous pursuit, and show that the FSI&#x02013;SPN circuit implements the distance&#x02013;velocity transformation, the key computation required for the precise guidance of volitional behavior.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par32">Male and female C57BL/6J mice were used in all experiments.
