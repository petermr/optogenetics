However, little is known of the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. New optogenetic experimental paradigms based on spatial profiles or patterns of light stimulation offer the prospect of elucidating many aspects of single cell function, including the role of dendrites in gain control. We thus developed a model to investigate how competing excitatory and inhibitory input within the dendritic arbor alters neuronal gain, incorporating kinetic models of opsins into our modeling to ensure it is experimentally testable. To investigate how different topologies of the neuronal dendritic tree affect the neuron&#x02019;s input-output characteristics we generate branching geometries which replicate morphological features of most common neurons, but keep the number of branches and overall area of dendrites approximately constant. We found a relationship between a neuron&#x02019;s gain modulability and its dendritic morphology, with neurons with bipolar dendrites with a moderate degree of branching being most receptive to control of the gain of their input-output relationship. The theory was then tested and confirmed on two examples of realistic neurons: 1) layer V pyramidal cells&#x02014;confirming their role in neural circuits as a regulator of the gain in the circuit in addition to acting as the primary excitatory neurons, and 2) stellate cells. In addition to providing testable predictions and a novel application of dual-opsins, our model suggests that innervation of all dendritic subdomains is required for full gain modulation, revealing the importance of dendritic targeting in the generation of neuronal gain control and the functions that it subserves. Finally, our study also demonstrates that neurophysiological investigations which use direct current injection into the soma and bypass the dendrites may miss some important neuronal functions, such as gain modulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>New experimental techniques based on optogenetics allow neuronal activity to be manipulated with a high degree of spatial and temporal precision. This opens up new prospects for testing computational models of neuronal function, including questions such as the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. However, compartmental models in computational neuroscience have not, until now, incorporated the kinetic models of opsins that are required in order to directly match the predictions of a computational model with observed optogenetic experimental results. Here, we introduce an approach for computational optogenetic modeling to test hypotheses, demonstrating it with application to the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. We find that gain modulability is indicated by dendritic morphology, with pyramidal cell-like shapes optimally receptive to modulation. All dendritic subdomains are required for gain modulation&#x02014;partial illumination is insufficient. Due to the simulation framework used, these results are directly testable through optogenetic experiments. Computational optogenetic models thus can be used to improve and refine experimental protocols for direct testing of theories of neural function.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Sk&#x00142;odowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>628086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jarvis</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L018268/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nikolic</surname><given-names>Konstantin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/N002474/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nikolic</surname><given-names>Konstantin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>319818</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nikolic</surname><given-names>Konstantin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/K001817/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6794-5813</contrib-id><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Simon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISSF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6794-5813</contrib-id><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Simon R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/L018268/1 and BB/K001817/1), the EPSRC (EP/N002474/1), the European Research Council (319818), EU Marie Curie 628086 and the Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund.

Its role in neuronal computation has been the subject of much investigation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and its dysfunction has been implicated in a range of disorders from attention deficit disorders, through to schizophrenia, autism and epilepsy [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Neocortical neurons vary in modulability, with gain modulation having been observed in cortical pyramidal cells from layers 2/3, 5 and 6 [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], whereas input-output relationships in some other cell types, such as entorhinal stellate cells, appear to be much less modulable [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite their role as the principal excitatory neuronal class within the cortex, it is unknown which properties of pyramidal cells are necessary in order to modulate their gain.</p><p>Gain modulation is signified by a change in the gradient of the input-output function of a neuron, in comparison to an overall change in excitability, which is instead evident as a lateral shift. There have been several proposed mechanisms for how a neuron alters the relationship between its input and output, including the use of shunting inhibition to shift the input-output curve [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and varying the rate of background synaptic noise, decreasing the ability of the neuron to detect target input signals [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A subsequent theoretical study posits that both mechanisms may be necessary [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which is supported by experimental evidence from intracellular <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], indicating that these processes are not mutually exclusive and may instead operate in different regimes. Notably, theoretical studies have used point neuron models, while experimental studies have injected current into the soma. However, as <italic>in situ</italic> the processing of individual synaptic inputs occurs within the dendrites rather than somatically, this raises another possibility: that gain modulation may involve dendritic processing. The modulation of gain is affected by the balance between excitation and inhibition, and as dendrites act to integrate inputs from throughout their arbors, their capacity for mediating between attenuation and saturation is highly dependent upon the local configuration of dendritic segments and synaptic inputs [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This suggests the possibility that the morphology of the dendritic tree itself is sufficient for managing attenuation and saturation of inputs, thereby facilitating a neuron&#x02019;s capacity for gain modulation.</p><p>To date, technical limitations in observing and manipulating activity at multiple locations throughout the dendritic arbor have made experimental studies of the dendritic contribution to neuronal gain control infeasible. While recording from single or a small number of dendritic locations is possible [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], this technique is not suited to manipulating activity over multiple locations, mimicking the thousands of inputs a pyramidal cell receives <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, optogenetics may prove to be a better method for manipulating dendritic activity, as light-activated opsins can be expressed throughout the entire membrane of the neuron&#x02014;including the dendrites. The existence of both excitatory [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and inhibitory opsins [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] suggests the possibility of altering the balance of excitatory and inhibitory currents locally in dendrites, to act as a synthetic substitute for the effect of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic input. This raises the prospect of a viable experimental method with which to investigate the mechanisms of neuronal gain modulation in the whole cell, as opposed to studying somatic effects alone.</p><p>Here we demonstrate through a computational model that neuronal gain modulation can be determined by cell morphology, by means of a set of dendritic morphological features which mediate between attenuation and shunting to modulate neuronal output. The local interaction of competing excitatory and inhibitory inputs is sensitive to the placement of dendritic sections. This indicates that gain modulation can be achieved by altering the overall balance of excitation and inhibition that a neuron receives, rather than being dependent on the statistical properties of the synaptic input. As experimental validation of our work would require optogenetics, we tested our hypothesis in detailed, biophysical models of opsin-transfected neurons, using experimentally fitted models of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR), which when activated produced excitatory and inhibitory photocurrents.</p><p>This study proposes a new perspective on the contribution of dendritic morphology to the characteristics of neurons, relating the shape of their dendritic arbors directly to their functional role within the neural circuit. We show that all dendritic subdomains are required for gain modulation to occur, suggesting that distinct innervation through synaptic targeting by discrete presynaptic populations could be an effective mechanism by which a neuron&#x02019;s output can be quickly gated between high gain and low gain modes. By incorporating kinetic opsin models within our detailed, compartmental neuron modeling approach, we make predictions which are directly testable by optogenetic experiments. In particular, our model leads to the proposal of a new illumination protocol for a more naturalistic method of neuronal photostimulation&#x02014;in which rather than simply imposing spikes or shutting down neuronal activity entirely, it is possible to increase or decrease the gain of a neuron&#x02019;s response to existing inputs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>In the results, below, we use the terminology <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> to describe simulations. For clarity, <italic>in vitro</italic> is here taken to indicate a single point injection (as in typical patch clamp experiments), and <italic>in vivo</italic> refers to population synaptic-like input activity. In this way, we emphasize the significant difference between whether the driving input as a single point or multiple synaptic sites.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Dendritic morphology determines gain modulation</title><p>We begin with a modified ball-and-stick model, comprising of a single soma and approximately 126 dendritic sections with only passive properties. We systematically rearranged the dendrites to vary polarity via the number of primary branches <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> and the branching patterns via the number of sister branches at each bifurcation <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> of the resulting arbor (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Methods</xref>) such that they were symmetrical around the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The total number of branches is controlled by the number of bifurcation stages (<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>&#x02113;</italic></sub>, this number includes the creation of primary branches). This enabled us to generate 20 distinct dendritic morphologies. As the number of sections remained approximately constant, thus fixing the spatial extent of the dendritic arbor, this allowed us to identify if a neuron&#x02019;s capacity for gain modulation could be determined by the dendritic arrangement, independently of total dendritic area, and if so, to establish which specific morphological features contribute.

To understand the interaction between neuron-wide activation (as provided by the photocurrent) and a single point input (such as current injection or presynaptic input), we evaluated first the steady-state response of the abstract models when photocurrents were induced throughout the entire dendritic arbor, before considering separately the current injection in a single distal branch.</p><p>Excitatory and inhibitory opsins (ChR2 and NpHR, respectively) were included throughout the dendritic tree in addition to the soma, and generate excitatory and inhibitory photocurrents when photoactivated. We set the opsin expression (defined by <italic>g</italic><sub>photo</sub> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006027.e002">Eq (1)</xref>) to be inversely proportional to the area of each compartment, and fixed the irradiance to be equal across the entire neuronal surface, thus ensuring the resulting photocurrent induced for each section is constant. Measuring the net photocurrent locally along the length of the dendritic arbor while shifting the ratio between NpHR and ChR2 (<italic>xNpHR</italic>) whilst keeping all other conductances constant, different dendritic morphologies summate the photocurrents such that the voltage measured at the soma is influenced by branching and polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), where morphologies with no branching show a small amplitude for the photocurrent. This relationship between net amplitude and branching was consistent across all arbor shapes we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), providing the first indication that different neuron types will sum the photocurrents differently.</p><p>Like [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we injected current at a single point on a distal, terminating branch and measured the membrane voltage across the path between the input site and soma, along with sites at sister branches, which indicated the amount of voltage attenuation that occurred without photocurrents included (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, note differing voltage scales). For a fixed amount of current injected on a single terminating branch, the perturbation when measured at the soma followed an identical trend as to that observed for the photocurrents in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, due to the symmetry of the dendritic configuration, varying however in magnitude. This suggests that the magnitude of depolarization from photoactivation has to be matched to that obtained from the point input; mismatch will result in the neuron&#x02019;s output being determined by the dominant term. Thus, if there is a fixed point input, this requires the amount of photoillumination to be matched to the dendritic morphology. We additionally measured the depolarization when both photoillumination and current injection were included, and found that it was a linear sum of the responses we observed separately for both types of input, as expected as there were only passive ion channels in the dendrites.</p><p>Whether the input was dendrites-wide or a single point, these dual methods of driving the neuron illustrate their respective effects: that for both methods, depolarization is largest and most effective for branched structures. For sustained whole cell photoactivation, the induced photocurrent acts to raise or lower the effective resting membrane potential, upon which the depolarization from a single (or multiple) distal point can further drive the membrane at the soma to threshold. These results also indicate that the effect of the photoactivation can dominate the neuron&#x02019;s response if not matched to the relative level of activation induced by current injection at a single point.</p><p>To contrast and compare these results with the impact of the dendritic tree when the input is located at the soma, we investigated the four characteristic dendritic morphologies from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1A</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006027.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This situation has been previously extensively investigated, e.g. Eyal et. al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and was found that the shape and size of dendritic arbors strongly modulate the onset of action potentials by regulating the impedance load attached to the soma. The dendritic tree acts as a current sink in this case, and its impedance affects the soma depolarisation.</p><p>We then quantified the transient response by driving the neuron with spiking input, mimicking excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) events included at set of locations at a terminating branch distal to the soma. By changing the rate of presynaptic events and then measuring the neuron&#x02019;s firing rate we get the background firing rate when not illuminated, before repeating with irradiance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), we were able to measure the gain of the neuron while varying the E:I balance by changing the ratio of ChR2 to NpHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). For <italic>irr</italic> = 0.02 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, we found that gain modulation was achieved in a subset of dendritic morphologies, marked by an increase in the gradient of the response as opsin activation moved from being dominated by inhibition to excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p><p>To identify whether there was a consistent trend between dendritic configuration and gain modulation, we define a new measure we term the gain modulation index (<italic>M</italic>), as the relative change in gradient of the response curves (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1F</xref>) when dominated by ChR2 and NpHR respectively, i.e. <italic>M</italic> = (<italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>ChR</italic>2</sub> &#x02212; <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>NpHR</italic></sub>)/<italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>balanced</italic></sub> for the difference in angles for the two responses (the slope for <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>balanced</italic></sub> is approximately tan(<italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sub><italic>balanced</italic></sub>) &#x02248; 1). An <italic>M</italic> &#x02243;0 indicates that no gain modulation occurred, whereas increasing <italic>M</italic> indicates an increasing degree of gain modulation. We found that there was a small region for which modulation was substantial, and correlated to dendritic structures that were multipolar with a small degree of branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1G</xref>, point <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = 4, <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 2; note that a discrete set of measurements is additionally presented as a continuous colourmap for the purpose of better visualisation). Following our earlier indication that photoactivation has to be matched to dendritic structure, we measured the modulation for irradiance values an order of magnitude smaller and greater. When <italic>irr</italic> = 0.002 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> we observed no gain modulation for all dendritic configurations (not shown), as their responses were dominated by the current injection. Increasing the <italic>irr</italic> = 0.2 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> expanded the region of dendritic configurations which displayed gain modulation, which was now most prominent for bipolar morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g001">Fig 1H</xref>).

As this principle would hold for all dendritic morphologies, our findings demonstrate that partial illumination incapacitates gain modulation and illustrates that coordinated activation between dendritic branches is necessary for full gain modulation.</p><p>We then tested partial illumination in our detailed neuron model of a L5PC by targeting the apical dendrites, reflecting a realistic scenario in which light from a superficially located source would be more likely to penetrate the apical rather than basal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Similarly to abstract models with two primary branches, we found that partial illumination abolished gain modulation in L5PC when driven by current injection at a site in the apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi.1006027.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006027.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Partial and graded illumination in L5PC.</title><p>(A) Partial illumination in L5PC model, where the apical but not the basal dendrites are illuminated; (B) The resulting IF curve for partial illumination shows no gain modulation for same input as used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, where full illumination showed strong gain modulation; (C) Graded illumination over L5PC, from superficial layer at apical dendrites; (D,E) Graded illumination for fixed xNpHR and irradiance, for different combinations of graded illumination. For both axis zero represents no grading (i.e. uniform irradiation of complete apical tree), and one represents maximum grading which goes from the nominal irradiation at the top to zero irradiation at the bottom. The responses for no graded illumination (purple circles) are moderately reduced when ChR2 is scattered slightly more than NpHR (blue circles), and nearly abolished when ChR2 is scattered significantly more than NpHR (green circles).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1006027.g006"/></fig><p>A more realistic experimental scenario is one in which the likelihood of photons scattering rises with increasing depth, corresponding to a continuous gradient for the effective irradiance that decreases with distance from the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Furthermore, as opsin activation occurs by illumination using a wavelength that is normally chosen optimally for each opsin (subject to available laser lines), and longer wavelengths proportionally penetrate distances, we examined the penetration gradients for ChR2 and NpHR independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Previously, we had only considered full-illumination of both ChR2 and NpHR with no graded illumination, which was equivalent to a gradient value of 0.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, top-left corner, purple circles). Now, by fixing <italic>xNpHR</italic> and irradiance while activating the L5PC without any additional driving stimulus, we could chart how independently varying each gradient impacted on the firing rate.</p><p>We observed three trends that are consistent with our earlier observations: (i) increasing the <italic>xNpHR</italic> factor increased the contribution of the NpHR gradient, which decreased the firing rate; (ii) a ChR2 gradient = 0.0 (signifying full ChR2 illumination) and a NpHR gradient of 1.0 resulted the largest firing rates; (iii) higher irradiance values led to higher firing rates, increasing the range of ChR2 gradients for which the neuron fired. However, we were interested in cases that correspond to the realistic scenario in which longer wavelengths penetrate through tissue further. As the preferential activation wavelengths for ChR2 and NpHR are &#x003bb; = 475nm and 590nm respectively, this manifests as a bias towards NpHR-dominated regimes. Introducing a small degree of graded illumination reduced the firing rate; the neuron was further silenced by increasing the NpHR gradient from a slight bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, blue circles) to a significant relative difference between ChR2 and NpHR gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006027.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, green circles).</p><p>The modulation by graded illumination was ubiquitous, although dependent on the irradiance, <italic>xNpHR</italic> value and scatter gradients for each wavelength. Experimentally, these effects can be easily overcome by prior calibration to compensate for the effects of scattering, but serve to highlight the sensitivity of a neuron to deviations from unequal innervation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec009"><title>An ideal dendritic morphology for gain modulation?</title><p>Previous work [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] examined what input properties are required to alter the output gain of the neuron. Critically, these studies took a somatocentric viewpoint, concentrating on the output of the neuron for a given input, but bypassing the computation performed by the neuron itself. In this work, we addressed the contribution of the dendrites directly, by considering how their configuration may help or hinder modulation of the neuron&#x02019;s activity and thus explain why some classes of neurons, but not others, contribute to setting the gain in a neural circuit. We established that the configuration of dendrites can affect a neuron&#x02019;s capacity for gain modulability, with a centrally placed soma and a moderate amount of branching being most receptive to gain modulation. As this shape closely matched pyramidal cells, this reinforces that their role within neural circuits is to act not only as the primary excitatory neuron but also as a key element in the setting of the gain of the circuit. Thus, in addition to the influence of dendrites on firing patterns [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and their role in dendritic computation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], our results demonstrate a new aspect to dendrites that directly relates the morphological properties of an individual neuron to its functional role within a network.</p><p>We explored the relation between a neuron&#x02019;s dendritic morphology and capacity to alter its firing rate by using excitatory and inhibitory photocurrents locally input to each dendritic section. The use of photocurrents, as well as making the study relate more closely to putative optogenetic validation experiments, was intended to mimic the local excitatory and inhibitory currents induced by the numerous presynaptic inputs located throughout the entire dendritic tree, with the notable difference in that while postsynaptic potentials are transient, the photocurrents we induce were typically close to steady-state. Further input was additionally applied that mimicked <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> input. We made no specific assumptions as to the specific type of stimulus representation of the input, such as visual contrast [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], orientation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or other stimulus traits; our results hold for the general case in which a driving input at discrete set of location is modulated by neuron-wide distributed drive.</p><p>Using this framework allowed us to identify that dendritic branching and the relative location of the soma were the most important morphological characteristics, as dendritic branching allowed balance between saturation and attenuation while a centrally located soma avoided it acting as a current sink. As previously established in [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], these effects become crucial when considering the compounded local input that is applied to each dendritic section (here, the non-driving input i.e., the photocurrents). For L5PC neurons, the stratified output for illumination suggests that if net drive to the dendrite is able to sufficiently cover the entire arbor, then L5PCs will be gain-modulable independent of the location of the driving input, which has been shown to govern the input-output relationship for single inputs [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In this respect, our findings suggest that gain modulation should be achievable regardless of the specific input location. However, there is one critical caveat: that the input must be dendritic. The absolute abolition of gain modulation when the driving input was located at the soma in a pyramidal cell reinforces the role of dendrites in processing input and their contribution to modulating gain. It also highlights the difficulties associated with experimentally unraveling neuronal mechanisms which involve dendritic processing. While recording at the soma gives us an exact measure of the cells output, injecting input directly to the soma bypasses the dendrites, rendering their contribution invisible. Instead, techniques such as dendritic patching or extracellular drive are more suitable for this purpose, despite their respective technical challenge or lack of control for the number and locations of synaptic sites. The future development of holographic methods in combination with optogenetics provides potential solution to both limitations, although it is currently limited by the tradeoff between number of distinct sites that can be targeted and the frequency of their stimulation [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>We note here that we attempted to use only passive conductances in biophysical models, in order to have better comparison with abstract neurons in interpreting the role of dendritic morphology, since their models include some active conductance (although in relatively low concentrations). However, due to their configuration and complexity we were unable to obtain normal neuronal responses i.e resting potential did not equilibrate in the experimentally observed range, due to different parameters required for the L5PC and stellate cells to operate in the passive regime.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>The importance of presynaptic targeting for full gain modulation</title><p>Quantifying the effect of partial illumination revealed that gain modulation also requires the participation of all dendritic subdomains. Removing background input from dendritic subdomains resulted in the unactivated arbors becoming a current sink, and reduced the ability of the neuron to modulate gain.</p><p>Tracing studies have hinted that within pyramidal cells in sensory areas, there is synaptic targetting with feedforward presynaptic input from the thalamus tends to synapse onto basal dendrites, while input from higher cortical areas instead connects within apical dendrites [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This arrangement of separate innervation to distinct dendritic subdomains would very easily allow for the same mechanistic process as we have observed here, whereby both feedforward and feedback connections are required for full gain modulation. Removal of one of these sources, such as the feedback input from higher cortical areas, would quickly act to shunt any background drive to corresponding dendritic subdomain, thus providing a mechanism for rapid switching between full gain modulation and no gain. As we observed that the modulation of gain approximately scales with the fraction of the dendritic subdomains that receive background driving input, the change between full gain and no gain can be most effectively controlled with two dendritic subdomains, as increasing the number of subdomains requires greater coordination between distinct input areas.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Application and improvement of optogenetic protocols</title><p>An important feature of computational models of neuronal information processing is that they be experimentally testable. Traditionally, for biophysically detailed, compartmental models of neurons, this has involved making predictions that can be confirmed by intracellular recording (whole cell patch clamp or sharp microelectrode) experiments. However, recent years have seen new optogenetic experimental paradigms come to the forefront of neuroscience, which are likely to form the basis of many experimental designs to test principles of neuronal function. Computational modeling of neuronal function should incorporate simulation of experimental predictions made by the model; whereas in the past this was largely electrophysiological, this now includes both electrophysiological and optogenetic predictions. We envisage that computational optogenetic modeling is likely to assist in bridging the gap between computational and experimental studies in areas ranging from neuroscience [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] to cardiac electrophysiology [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. For this reason, in the current study we incorporated kinetic models of opsin into the biophysically detailed neuron models described here.</p><p>Optogenetic illumination protocols in current use can generally be classified as &#x0201c;hard control&#x0201d;, in which the output of a cell is written directly by using high levels of illumination to induce either spiking or hyperpolarization [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The problem with such approaches is that they effectively reprogram the output of the neuron, disrupting/eliminating the information processing operation that it is performing on its inputs. We suggest that a more refined method of optogenetic modulation would preserve the cell&#x02019;s ability for its outputs to be affected by its inputs, but altering the gain of this input/output transformation. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility and support the development of such optogenetic control of individual neuronal gain. In this approach, using whole-field, low-level illumination allows for subthreshold dynamics to dominate, and the neuron remains driven by its presynaptic input, with the gain of its input-output function modulated by activation of a mixture of opsins. In the current work, we demonstrated that a combination of channelrhodopsin and halorhodopsin can provide a suitable opsin mix, with effect dependent upon target cell morphology.</p><p>For the general purpose of optogenetic gain control, step-function opsins (SFO) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and stabilized step-function opsins (SSFO) [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] may be suitable, as they do not required continuous illumination to be active, and have their suitability for loose control has already been demonstrated when driven by inputs located at the soma [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. SFOs and SSFOs have already been proposed for use in the study of plasticity and homeostatic mechanisms during development. Our results support their suitability for application to gain modulation <italic>in vivo</italic> but also predict a restriction to their usage that will be dependent on the class of neurons to be targeted. More generally, our findings suggest that smaller, rather than larger, photocurrent amplitudes are desirable for the purpose of modulating gain.</p><p>Unequal or incomplete optical activation of the entire dendritic arbor also has significant implications for experiments that include optogenetics. We used optogenetics specifically as opsins are expressed on the surface membrane, and therefore can generate photocurrents locally within the dendrites. Experimentally, however, opsins may be non-uniformly distributed throughout the neuronal membrane, while optical point sources incompletely illuminate the entire membrane surface area, which is further compounded by scatter effects as light moves through tissue. We quantified the impact of optical scattering by examining how graded illumination alters the gain modulation curves of a L5PC, for the scenario when the scattering was equal but also for the more realistic scenario where it is unequal. For instance, ChR2 is activated at &#x003bb; = 475nm, while NpHR is preferentially activated at &#x003bb; = 590nm, which penetrates further through tissue. From our results, approximately equal attenuation for both wavelengths only slightly decreases the firing rate; as this imbalance increases and shifts towards longer wavelengths, we found a substantial decrease in firing rate due to this physical constraint that biases in favor of NpHR. Additionally, although ChR2 and NpHR have different peak absorption wavelengths, they both are activated over a larger range of wavelengths, and consequently there is low-level activation of NpHR at &#x003bb; = 475nm, further biasing dual activation towards NpHR-dominated regimes. These effects can be experimentally compensated for by calibrating curves as the ratio of ChR2 to NpHR is varied, but require explicit measurement for individual experiments. The issue of precise co-activation of both excitatory and inhibitory opsins can be addressed by development of better dual opsins, as well as of better techniques for controled 3D illumination. Several options already exist, such as holographic spatially patterned illumination technology [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and individually addressable LED micro-arrays [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>More generally, identifying the impact of experimental effects is critical for the improvement and refinement of optogenetics. While optogenetics offers new possibilities for precise spatial and temporal targeting of distinct neural populations, practical hurdles such as optimally designing illumination protocols are more difficult to identify through experimental means. Additionally, as new opsin variants with differing kinetics becoming available, the task of identifying which opsin is best suited to match the intrinsic dynamics of a target neuron class becomes increasingly impractical to test. For these aims, the use of computational models of opsins will become increasingly significant [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], from the level of channel kinetics, to the level of a single neuron [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and beyond to the level of the network.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Methods</title><p>All simulations were performed in NEURON and Python [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

Altogether, we generated 31 different dendritic configurations that, despite their geometrical configuration, had approximately equal surface areas and volumes.

Synapses themselves were modeled using NEURON&#x02019;s <monospace>ExpSyn</monospace> model, with input spiketimes drawn from independent Poisson process. As different dendritic morphologies had different electrotonic distances from synapse location to soma, synaptic weights were chosen where possible such that the output firing rate was approximately equal to the input firing rate, enforcing a loose version of synaptic democracy. For some arbor configurations, the length from soma to distal dendrites was greater than the electrotonic distance and a transient response could not be obtained. The dendrite tapering was not included in our simulation for abstract neurons, but it is included for two realistic biophysical neuron models. Inclusion of tapering for abstract neurons creates a problem of keeping approximately the same total dendritic tree area for various morphologies, which was the more relevant factor with respect to our results.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Biophysical models</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Layer 5 pyramidal cell</title><p>We used a previously published model of L5PC [<xref rid="pcbi.1006027.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], ModelDB: no.139653 (cell: L5PCbiophys3).
