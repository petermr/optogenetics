Genetic strategies using Cre-dependent mouse strains, especially the Ai32 line expressing Channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-EYFP fusion protein, have been a popular means to drive opsin expression in a cell-type specific manner. Here we report a low level of leaky &#x02018;off-target&#x02019; (Cre-independent) ChR2-EYFP expression in Ai32/Ai32 homozygous mice throughout the nervous system. This leaky off-target expression was characterized in multiple prevalent nervous system regions using anti-EYFP immunostaining. Expression of full-length ChR2-EYFP protein was confirmed using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. Notably, light stimulation of these ChR2-EYFP expressing neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn did not induce detectable photocurrents in juvenile 4-week old mice. Given the wide use of the Ai32 line by many labs, our results suggest researchers should be vigilant of possible off-target ChR2-EYFP expression in their region of interest, especially when generating Ai32/Ai32 homozygotes to drive high levels of ChR2-EYFP expression in adult mice.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS083702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2486-807X</contrib-id><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Wenqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS094224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2486-807X</contrib-id><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Wenqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS092297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2486-807X</contrib-id><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Wenqin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">www.nih.gov</ext-link>) (NS083702 and NS094224 to W.L and NS092297 to W.O.) and the Klingenstein-Simons Fellowship Award in the Neurosciences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.klingfund.org">http://www.klingfund.org</ext-link>) to W.L.

In this technique, target cells are driven to express light-sensitive opsins, which are commonly ion channels. For example, Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a blue light-gated non-specific cation channel that drives neuronal activation [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Blue light illumination in ChR2 expressing animals allows for specific, temporally precise control of neuronal activity in a wide range of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Genetic strategies using Cre-dependent mouse strains have been a popular means to drive opsin expression in a cell-type specific manner. For example, using a <italic>Rosa</italic> knock-in loxP-STOP-loxP strategy that allows for high-level, specific transgene expression [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], Madisen et al engineered multiple mouse lines for Cre-dependent, robust expression of opsins [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These lines are very useful reagents for the neuroscience research community. One of these lines, the Ai32 line expressing a ChR2-EYFP fusion protein, has been widely used for cell-type specific expression of ChR2. Following the cassette design for the <italic>Rosa</italic> knock-in allele, the Ai32 uses the CAG promoter and a woodchuck hepatitis virus posttranscriptional regulatory element (WPRE) to drive high levels of ChR2-EYFP expression [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the original paper, the authors reported that, while other lines showed some background (Cre-independent) expression of opsin mRNA, the Ai32 line does not express ChR2-EYFP in the absence of Cre recombinase.</p><p>In our research, we occasionally noticed ChR2-EYFP expression in Cre-positive Ai32 mice in a manner that was not predicated based on Cre-line recombination pattern. We therefore sought to examine the possibility of off-target, or &#x0201c;leaky&#x0201d;, expression of ChR2-EYFP in Ai32/Ai32 homozygous mice in the absence of Cre. We performed immunostaining for EYFP of Ai32/Ai32 mice and indeed found leaky ChR2-EYFP expression throughout the nervous system. We also confirmed that this EYFP signal corresponds to full length ChR2-EYFP protein using immunoprecipitation. Our results suggest that the strong gene expression driven by this <italic>Rosa</italic> cassette can result in background off-target expression of ChR2-EYFP, especially in Ai32/Ai32 homozygous mice. Nevertheless, light stimulation of these ChR2-EYFP expressing neurons in dorsal horn of the spinal cord slices did not induce detectable photocurrents in 4-week old juvenile mice. In short, our study clearly showed background expression of ChR2-EYFP in Ai32 homozygous mice. Given the popularity of the Ai32 line, this finding suggests that researchers using this line should be vigilant of possible off-target ChR2-EYFP expression in their region of interest, especially in adult mice as ChR2-EFYP expression level accumulates with age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>Mice were raised in a barrier facility in Hill Pavilion, the University of Pennsylvania.

Based on our previous experience [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], 0.1ms blue laser pulse durations are sufficient to induce photocurrents in Cre-driven ChR2 expressing spinal cord DH neurons. In addition, these recorded cells are viable and responsive, as they show action potential firing upon current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213326.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).

However, our results do not exclude the possibility that this leaky expression of ChR2 could generate photocurrents with stronger light stimulation or with potentially higher expression levels in adult mice.</p><fig id="pone.0213326.g007" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0213326.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Leaky expression of ChR2(H134R)-EYFP in dorsal spinal cord neurons of four-week-old Ai32 mice is not sufficient to generate photocurrents.</title><p>(A) ChR2-EYFP expression in dorsal horn of lumbar spinal cord slice from 4 pw Ai32/Ai32 mice (scale bar 0.1 mm).

While this expression occurred throughout the nervous system, we identified regions with particularly high ChR2-EYFP expression including the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebellum, and other regions. While anti-EFYP immunostaining allows for clear identification of this off-target expression, the level of this expression is likely to be much lower compared to Cre-driven Ai32 ChR2-EYFP. Indeed, our western blotting results reveal much lower amounts of ChR2-EYFP purified from Ai32/Ai32 (Cre-negative) OB lysates in comparison with <italic>Omp</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup>-driven positive control tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213326.g006">Fig 6</xref>). While previous work has reported no Cre-independent ChR2-EFYP mRNA expression in this line [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it is possible that the off-target leaky expression we found is related to the use of Ai32/Ai32 homozygous tissue. We also found that, although the leaky expression of ChR2-EFYP is obvious in some areas of nervous system, this expression is not sufficient to generate a detectable photo current at least in the spinal cord of 4-week old mice, likely due to the low level of ChR2 present in these cells.</p><p>The Ai32 line uses a CAG promoter cassette organization designed to drive high levels of transgene expression. The off-target expression we found is possibly a consequence of &#x02018;read-through&#x02019; transmission of the floxed stop element, especially given the strong promoter used to drive this cassette. Notably, other lines using this cassette organization have been reported to show off-target transgene mRNA expression [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While read-through transcription of similar floxed stop elements has been reported in other Cre-reporter transgene systems [<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0213326.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], such transcription has been shown to be considerably weaker than expression after Cre-mediated stop element excision, consistent with our results. It should be noted that, during propagation, the Ai32 line used in this study have been crossed to other lines, and this genetic background variability may contribute to this off-target leaky expression of ChR2-EFYP. The presence of this leaky ChR2-EYFP expression is an important consideration for labs using this line, specifically in the use of EYFP immunostaining to characterize ChR2 expression in <italic>Ai32</italic> mice. Further, while we did not see functional photocurrents in our recordings with spinal cord dorsal horn neurons at 4 week old, we cannot rule out the possibility of functional effects of leaky ChR2 expression after light stimulation either through some modulatory effect or by direct activation in cells with higher expression levels in adult mice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Peter Dong and Andrew Moberly for providing mouse tissue for these studies, as well as Dr. Alice Chen-Plotkin for the use of the ChemiDoc Western Blot imaging system.
