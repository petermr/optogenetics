Granule neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus are vulnerable to stressors that impair contextual memory function and can be influenced by dietary polyphenols. We utilized a c-fos-tTA/TRE-ChR2 optogenetics model in which neurons activated during fear learning are labeled with ChR2-mCherry and can be optically reactivated in a different context to recapitulate the behavioral output of a related memory. Treatment with dietary polyphenols increased fear memory recall and ChR2-mCherry expression in dentate gyrus neurons, suggesting that dietary polyphenols promote recruitment of neurons to a fear memory engram. We show that dietary polyphenols promote memory function and offer a general method to map cellular subpopulations influenced by dietary polyphenols, in part through the mechanism of c-Fos expression enhancement.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Chad Smith et al. show that dietary polyphenols, compounds found in grapes, enable mice to remember fearful events more effectively and map this function to the hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons.

Conditions of stress that negatively impact synaptic plasticity impair performance in the CFC paradigm, even when previously-activated DG granule neurons are activated through optogenetic stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. As these deficits can be rescued through treatment with dietary polyphenols and activation of context-related DG neurons is sufficient to recapitulate behavior associated with memory, we focused on modulations of DG granule neurons by dietary polyphenols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

As treatments with dietary polyphenols mediate benefits in various functions in these regions, it would be intriguing to investigate whether the c-fos-tTA/TRE-ChR2 optogenetics model could also be adapted to these regions and map responses of neurons to dietary polyphenols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Our study focuses only on performance in the CFC paradigm. In our study, we noticed a general increase in freezing across all treatment groups (~15%) from the Habituation to Recall session (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). This suggests an increase in anxiety levels induced by fear conditioned that could not be eliminated by our experimental design and could not be examined through anxiety-related tests in our paradigm. The function of DG granule neurons plays a role in a number of behavioral tests, including spatial memory tests such as the Morris Water Maze and Conditioned Place Preference tests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. As optogenetic manipulations of the DG have been found to modulate behavior responses in the Conditioned Place Preference and Place Avoidance tasks, it would be intriguing to investigate whether dietary polyphenols are able to enhance recapitulation of behavior in tests with a spatial component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Expanding the use of the c-fos-tTA/TRE-ChR2 optogenetics model to similar tests would eliminate confounding factors such as anxiety and map responses of subpopulations to dietary polyphenols in alternate behavioral tests.</p><p id="Par22">Through optogenetic manipulations, we have demonstrated that certain dietary polyphenols are able to deliver bioactive metabolites to the brain to promote memory function through the stimulation of c-Fos expression in DG granule neurons, and influence neurons to form a novel domain of a functional memory engram. In summary, our findings suggest a general method in which the c-fos-tTA/TRE-ChR2 inducible optogenetics model can be used to study the mechanisms through which dietary polyphenols confer benefits in memory function and identify neuronal subpopulations in various brain regions influenced by treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Subjects</title><p id="Par23">c-fos-tTA mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (#018306).
