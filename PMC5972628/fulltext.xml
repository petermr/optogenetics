Electrophysiological recordings offer remarkable observations of brain activity as they provide highly precise representations of information coding in both temporal and spatial domains. With the development of genetic tools over the last decades, mice have been a key model organism in neuroscience. However, conducting chronic <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology in awake, behaving mice remains technically challenging, and this difficulty prevents many research teams from acquiring critical recordings in their mouse models. Behavioral training, implant fabrication, brain surgery, data acquisition and data analysis are all required steps that must be mastered in order to perform cutting-edge experiments in systems neuroscience. Here, we present a new method that simplifies the construction of a drivable and multi-task electrophysiological recording implant without loss of flexibility and recording power. The hybrid-drive combining optogenetics, pharmacology and electrophysiology (HOPE) can support up to 16 tetrodes, attached to a single drive mechanism, organized in two bundles of eight tetrodes, allowing recordings in two different mouse brain regions simultaneously with two optical fibers for optogenetic manipulation or two injection cannulas for drug-delivery experiments. Because it can be printed with a latest-generation desktop 3D printer, the production cost is low compared to classical electrophysiology implants, and it can be built within a few hours. The HOPE implant is also reconfigurable to specific needs as it has been created in a computer-aided design (CAD) software and all the files used for its construction are open-source<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>drug delivery</kwd><kwd>microdrive</kwd><kwd>multi-site</kwd><kwd>electrode array</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Institute of Mental Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000025</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">R01 MH060379</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">CHDI Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100005725</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn002">A-5552</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="21"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5196"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Single-unit recordings made from tetrodes have been useful in linking neuronal activity to animal behavior. In particular, these methods allow detection of circuit dynamics if applied to populations of neurons at different nodes of neural circuits. <italic>In vivo</italic> electrophysiological recordings in awake, behaving mice have been particularly powerful for validating and studying different models of neuronal disease (Cacucci et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Cayzac et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Burgui&#x000e8;re et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Unfortunately, the fabrication of neural implants for such recordings in mice is time-consuming, and commercially available implants are expensive. In order to facilitate the fabrication of neural implants and reduce their cost of production, we have created a new type of implant and a set of useful construction tools. The development of stereolithography 3D printing gives researchers the opportunity to build compact, versatile and easily modifiable implants. The use of this technology requires the editing of a very precise plan for each part, which can be easily done via the graphic interface of a computer program. As the implant then could be rapidly printed for a low cost, it could be modified as necessary to meet the needs of a specific experiment. We have made such a system.</p><p>Intracerebral drug delivery enables external regulation of neurotransmitter pathways and has been successful in identifying neurotransmitter functions as well as in counterbalancing pathological neurotransmitter levels. The combination of electrophysiological recordings and intracerebral drug-delivery systems enables neuroscientists to study the impact of neurotransmission levels on brain activity at levels ranging from neural networks to single cells. Such combinations can also be used in closed-loop systems to adjust drug dosage according to the recorded neural response. These approaches are still very challenging (Kliem and Wichmann, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and therefore extremely rare in clinical treatment of humans or in non-human primate research. Rodent research plays a key role in the development of these new closed-loop drug delivery systems.</p><p>The development of optogenetic tools has provided the ability to manipulate specific neuronal networks and pathways at an extremely fine timescale (Boyden et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Zhang et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The combination of optogenetic manipulation with electrophysiological recordings adds a new dimension to electrophysiological recordings by allowing the user to be certain of the recorded cell-type (Friedman et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). One can know whether the recorded cell is a projection neuron or an interneuron and even what input-output connections it has (Wickersham et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have developed a method to permit use of these electrophysiological, pharmacologic and optogenetic methods in flexible combinations. Particular values of our system are ease of manufacture and low initial cost.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Implant and Construction Tools</title><p>We designed the HOPE implant to incorporate a 64-channel electrode interface board (EIB, Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT, USA) that is 26.2 mm wide, 22.2 mm long and 19.6 mm high (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The height of the implant results from the presence of a drive mechanism (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), allowing all of the electrodes to move up and down over a distance of 4 mm. The weight of the implant is 4.4 g, and its production cost is extremely small (&#x0003c;2 US$). Six 3D printed parts, an EIB and five screws (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) need to be assembled in order to build the implant. The central piece to which all the others are connected is called the body. The second part, called the shuttle, carries the electrodes and is penetrated by a 0&#x02013;80 screw at its center. As the shuttle fits snugly into the body, a full rotation of this 0&#x02013;80 screw will generate a vertical movement of 317.5 &#x003bc;m, moving the electrodes up and down. The third part, called the bar, holds the same screw against the EIB and prevents the screw from moving vertically. The fourth part, called optic fiber holder, is only present when the implant also carries optical fibers for optogenetic experiments. Two set screws are used for locking the fibers in place when they need to be connected to a patch cord, preventing them from breaking when a strong stress is applied to them. The fibers will be unlocked when the shuttle needs to move. Finally, the fifth and sixth pieces are the top and the bottom caps, which protect the implant from contamination or damage when the animal is in its home cage. In addition to the implant, three useful construction tools were designed to help in the fabrication of the implant. The first is called the tetrode-insertion stand, which serves to hold the body during the insertion of the tetrodes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). The second is the adjustment block, which is used to level the tetrodes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Finally, the third tool is a storage box to prevent damage to the implant when it has been fabricated. Each piece has been created using a 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software (Solidworks, Dassault Systems, France).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of the hybrid-drive combining optogenetics, pharmacology and electrophysiology (HOPE). <bold>(A)</bold> Outer view with dimensions. <bold>(B)</bold> Section view showing the drive mechanism used to move the shuttle. <bold>(C)</bold> Exploded view of the implant with all individual parts.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fncir-12-00041-g0001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Steps of HOPE-implant construction. <bold>(A)</bold> Insertion of the two polyimide-tube bundles into the shuttle. <bold>(B)</bold> Insertion of the shuttle into the body. <bold>(C)</bold> Insertion and cutting of the tetrodes. <bold>(D)</bold> Leveling of tetrode lengths. <bold>(E)</bold> Addition of the drive system (screw and bar) and the EIB. <bold>(F)</bold> Encapsulation of the implant.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fncir-12-00041-g0002"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Fabrication of the Implant</title><p>The designed pieces were 3D-printed using a Form2 printer (Formlabs, Cambridge, MA, USA). The printed parts were cleaned, and support material was carefully removed. The central channel in the shuttle was tapped using a 0&#x02013;80 tap. The size of the shuttle was decreased manually, with sandpaper, until it fit perfectly into the body. The tightness of the fit increases the stability of the recordings by minimizing possible movement of the shuttle. Two bundles of nine polyimide tubes (12 mm long, 0.0062&#x02033;/0.0092&#x02033; ID/OD, HPC Medical Products) were then assembled and inserted on each side of the shuttle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). After insertion, the polyimide tubes protruded from the bottom of the shuttle by 5.5 mm. The bundles were glued to the top of the shuttle, which has a rim that holds the glue, using a light cure adhesive (Loctite 4305). The part of the bundle extruding from the bottom of the shuttle was also covered with a thin layer of glue to hold all the polyimide tubes together, being careful to avoid sealing the polyimide-tube openings.</p><p>The alignment of the tetrode bundle is directly related to the alignment of the polyimide-tube bundle; this step has to be executed very carefully. After attaching both bundles to the shuttle, the shuttle was inserted into the body (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The drive mechanism (bar, screw, shuttle and body) presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> was tested at this point, and a top-view diagram of polyimide-tube bundles was drawn. The body was then mounted on the tetrode-insertion stand (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), and the tetrodes were inserted into the polyimide tubes one by one. Tetrodes were made following the standard fabrication protocol (Jog et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Nguyen et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), and the dimension of the wire and the number of turns required to create the tetrode varies depending of the desired final length of the tetrode as well as the diameter of the original wire used to build it. After insertion, the upper part of the tetrode was bent to fit within the teeth of the body. The ring of teeth located at the top of the body separated the tetrodes based on their connection to the EIB above. The tetrodes extended 1.5 cm above the top of the ring. The original top-view diagram was updated after the insertion of each tetrode so that one knew their location relative to the bundle of polyimide tubes. This information on the location of the tetrode is used in later analysis for histological assessment of tetrode position. After tetrode insertion, the stand was removed, and with fine scissors, each bundle was cut at the level of the ring located under the body. For final leveling of the tips of the tetrodes, the adjustment block was inserted into the body bottom-ring, and the tetrode tips were leveled. The tetrodes were then glued to the polyimide tubes on the top side of the shuttle. The adjustment block (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>) was then removed, and the drive mechanism (bar and screw) was assembled. The EIB was then mounted on the body, and tetrode wires were connected to it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Using a nanoZ (Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT, USA) and a gold solution, the electrodes were gold-plated to lower their impedance to 200&#x02013;300 k&#x003a9; (Jog et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). After gold plating, the electrodes were rinsed using deionized water. Finally, the protective bottom-cap and a top-cap were mounted and glued in place (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). These fabrication procedures are described in detail in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00041/full#supplementary-material">Supplementary Presentation</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Animals and Surgical Procedures</title><p>In this series of experiments, 15 C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and four parvalbumin (PV)-IRES-Cre (B6;129P2-<italic>Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup></italic>/J) &#x000d7; Ai39 (B6;129S-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm39(CAG-hop/EYFP)Hze</sup></italic>/J) mice (generated from PV-Cre and Ai39 lines purchased from Jackson Laboratory) were studied. All experimental procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council and were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA. For all microdrive implantations, we followed a precise series of surgical steps. Each mouse was deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (3% isoflurane in oxygen at 0.8 l/min flow rate), the head was shaved, and the mouse was head-fixed in a stereotaxic frame. The eyes were protected with ointment, the head was centered by adjusting ear-bar positions, the skin was cleaned three times with Betadine followed by 70% alcohol, and an incision was made in the skin to expose the calvarium. A sterile plastic ring was inserted underneath the skin to maintain the opening, the exposed region was cleaned, and the skull was leveled using the dorsoventral coordinates of Bregma and lambda. Two shallow openings were made in the skull with a 0.7 mm drill (AP = +4.0 mm, ML = &#x000b1;2.5 mm). The drill was stopped before the skull was fully perforated. Two skull screws were firmly attached to the skull at these two sites. Two craniotomies were initiated at AP = 0.85 mm and ML = &#x000b1;1.75 mm using a large circular drill bit (1.5 mm diameter). A small surgical hook was used to complete the craniotomy opening. The dura mater was incised using a small 30G needle bent near the tip, the dura mater was removed with fine forceps, and then the drive, attached to a stereotaxic arm, was lowered. The ground wire was wrapped around the skull screws, and the connection was strengthened using a drop of conductive silver paint on top of the head of the screw. Once the silver paint had dried, the screw was covered with a drop of ultraviolet (UV) curing glue (Loctite Flash Cure 4311 Cyanoacrylate), and the connection was sealed with 10 s of UV light. The drive was then lowered extremely slowly into the brain until the tetrodes reached the desired dorsoventral coordinates (&#x02212;2.5 mm). Finally, the HOPE drive was attached to the skull and was anchored to two skull screws using Metabond quick self-curing cement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Data Acquisition and Analysis</title><p>All neuronal signals were band-pass filtered between 0.1 Hz and 9000 Hz and recorded at 30 kHz using Open Ephys<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0002"><sup>2</sup></xref>.

The efficiency of light transmission was measured experimentally before implantation, and the power of the laser (593-nm light-pulses, 500 ms duration, randomly separated by 5.5&#x02013;8 s) was adjusted to 5 mW during stimulation experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Drug Delivery</title><p>For pharmacological experiments, one guide cannula was attached to the center of each bundle and adjusted such that the guide tips were located 1 mm above the tips of the tetrodes.

Muscimol was prepared in batches and stored at 4&#x000b0;C until 1 h before injection, when the muscimol was brought to room temperature. At the chosen site, 300 &#x003bc;l of muscimol was injected using an infusion pump (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL, USA) to control precisely the volume and flow rate of the intracerebral injection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Recording Activity of Striatal Neurons</title><p>The HOPE device was implanted in 15 C57BL/6 mice, and 16 tetrodes divided into two bundles of eight tetrodes were targeted to contralateral districts within the dorsal striatum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

Muscimol (0.3 &#x003bc;l) was injected over 3 min at a flow rate of 0.1 &#x003bc;l/min, and neuronal activity was not recorded during this period because the electric micro-pump generated electrical noise.

Compared to previously developed implants (Battaglia et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Nguyen et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Voigts et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Brunetti et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Liang et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>), the main characteristic of the presented implant is that it can be built easily by beginners, and it carries 16 movable tetrodes along with two optic fibers or two injection cannulas. Moreover, the HOPE implant has been designed with the help of 3D CAD software, allowing modifications for various experimental needs, such as targeting different brain regions and use in other animal species (e.g., rats and non-human primates). The implant can be designed to the shape of the skull of individual monkeys based on pre-implantation magnetic resonance imaging, thus optimizing the fit with the skull surface and making the recording from deep brain regions more reliable. As the different parts of the implant are 3D printed, it becomes inexpensive to produce the implant with an affordable desktop 3D printer. In fact, the price of the 3D printer is the price of one traditional commercially available implant for rats, and the implants themselves cost ~2 US$ in printing materials.</p><p>Despite these advantages, we should note that there are limitations to the HOPE implant. The weight of the implant could be an issue for young mice. This limitation could be overcome by making the body hollow inside and printing it with titanium to increase its strength. Also, during fabrication of the implant, the current design requires many steps to make individual parts. Cutting edge hybrid 3D printers can already produce a print made of different materials, such as plastic and silver in a single print. In the near future, it may be possible to print the entire implant in a single run, and multiple fabrication processes may become unnecessary.</p><p>The current HOPE implant is equipped only with a single drive to move all 16 tetrodes. However, with the hybrid 3D printing technology, the fabrication of implants with individual microdrives for each of these tetrodes may become possible. Such independently movable tetrodes are necessary when the target region consists of a thin layer of neurons. When larger regions are targeted, a simple drive mechanism could have a good yield, especially considering that adjusting each tetrode independently requires the experimenter to monitor and to isolate daily the units recorded from each tetrode. If few or no units are present, the experimenter generally decides to move the tetrode to identify more units. In order to move the tetrode, the animal must be slowly habituated to the procedure, as the experimenter will gently hold its head to make a small adjustment of the tetrode tip position by turning the screw of the tetrode carrier. At that time, there is a small risk that the tetrode will be disconnected from the circuit board if the animal tries to escape, or if the screwdriver slips on the head of the screw. One can wait for hours after lowering multiple tetrodes individually to make sure that the distance between the neurons and the tetrode is fully stabilized. With our design, we can still make adjustment of the tetrode location by moving all tetrodes at once if the quality of the recordings is getting too low or if the implants need to be removed from the brain. In some instances, this strategy can be advantageous for electrophysiological studies, where the number of animals is usually too low, although we fully realize the advantages of independent movement of the tetrodes during the course of prolonged experiments in mice (Kubota et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and larger rodents (Jog et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Barnes et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Thorn et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Delcasso et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>In sum, the flexibility of the HOPE drive presented here suggests that as new methods are introduced, this drive could be adapted for efficient use. With currently available methods, this device is effective and can be supported at low cost, and thus it is available to many interested in recording the activity of neurons in the brain as animals engage in a range of behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SDelcasso created the HOPE design.
