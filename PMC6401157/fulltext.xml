However, the functions of SCs in developmental and regenerative stages remain unclear. Here, we investigated how optogenetic stimulation (OS) of SCs regulates their development. In SC monoculture, OS substantially enhanced SC proliferation and the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>-S100&#x000df;<sup>+</sup>-SCs over time. In addition, OS also markedly promoted the expression of both Krox20 and myelin basic protein (MBP) in SC culture medium containing dBcAMP/NRG1, which induced differentiation. We found that the effects of OS are dependent on the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level. OS induces elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels through the T-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) and mobilization of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>)-sensitive stores and caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive stores. Furthermore, we confirmed that OS significantly increased expression levels of both Krox20 and MBP in SC-motor neuron (MN) coculture, which was notably prevented by pharmacological intervention with Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Taken together, our results demonstrate that OS of SCs increases the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and can regulate proliferation, differentiation, and myelination, suggesting that OS of SCs may offer a new approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016R1A4A1010796</award-id><award-id>2018R1A2A1A05019550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeon</surname><given-names>Noo Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100003710</institution-id><institution>Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI16C1012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Sung-Rae</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Axon regeneration and remyelination after injury are limited in the central nervous system (CNS) of adult mammals, but recovery capacity is considerably greater in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Schwann cells (SCs), a glial cell type of the PNS, are crucial for regeneration in the PNS. After peripheral nerve injury, SCs immediately transform into a dedifferentiated state and activate proliferation <italic>per se</italic>, forming bands of B&#x000fc;ngner in which SCs release numerous neurotrophic factors that guide axonal extensions and induce infiltration of macrophages into the injury site, to in turn remove cell debris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Dedifferentiated SCs can undergo redifferentiation through upregulation of myelin-associated genes and remyelinate the regenerating axons for complete functional recovery, but regeneration of the PNS with an injured area more than 3&#x02009;cm in size remains relatively unexplored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The potential efficacy of SCs is dependent on patient age, regeneration time, and injury extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Intensive treatment strategies have been shown to promote axon regeneration, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the regenerative response and long-distance axon regeneration are not fully understood. More advanced practical methods for determining the roles of SCs in promoting axon regeneration are essential.</p><p id="Par3">Optogenetics has gained attention as a promising biological technology, in which genetically modified cells within complex neural tissues are regulated using light of a specific wavelength after introducing light-sensitive microbial opsins, such as channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR-2), halorhodopsin (NpHR), and archaerhodopsin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This revolutionary technique can control the electrical processes of specific types of cells, including cell signaling, modulation, etc.; in particular, it affords unprecedented control of neural activity with high spatiotemporal precision in many types of nervous system investigations. To date, numerous optogenetic studies have demonstrated modulation of the neural system at the molecular and cellular levels through neuronal excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and biochemical control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> of intracellular membranes, the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear complexes, and mitochondria. More recently, a few studies on optogenetic applications have focused on glial cells, such as astrocytes, in the CNS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Regarding optogenetically manipulated astrocytes, their activation can be separated from that of nearby neurons, which may shed light on the role of glial cells in highly complex brain functions including modulation of synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, regulation of response selectivity of visual cortex neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, control of the sleep-wake cycle in the posterior hypothalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, and activation of ATP release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast to astrocytes, the possibility of optogenetic SCs has not been reported. When optogenetic-mediated dorsal root ganglia cells are stimulated, SCs have been shown to respond to nerve stimuli, and the proliferation and migration of SCs were regulated by optogenetic neuronal stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Accumulating evidence has shown that SCs play essential roles in neuronal survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, axon growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, and myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, but it has proven difficult to investigate their role in neuron-glia complexes. Although the actions of SCs are crucial to neurons, fundamental questions regarding their significance to the PNS remain unresolved.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we investigated an optogenetic approach that serves as a useful extension of the tools currently available to study SC function in the PNS. We focused on how optogenetic stimulation (OS) of SCs affects SC development, such as proliferation, differentiation, and myelination, and demonstrated that OS of SCs not only induces SC proliferation but also promotes the differentiation and myelination of SCs in SC monoculture. Moreover, we provided evidence that OS activity is correlated with a change in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level. We discuss below how OS affects the differentiation and myelination of SCs in a coculture model of SC and motor neuron (MN) cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>OS induces SC proliferation</title><p id="Par5">To investigate whether optogenetic-mediated SCs could perform the general biological functions of SCs, including proliferation and differentiation, we first performed SC proliferation analysis. SCs cultured on coverslips that had been pre-coated with poly-l-lysine (PLL) were transfected with 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of calcium-translocating channelrhodopsin (CatCh) DNA. Before examining SC proliferation, we verified the efficiency of CatCh transfection in the SC monoculture with a YFP-expressing plasmid, which was strongly expressed in the majority of SCs at DIV 7, with 92.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.6% of SCs being transfected (Suppl. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Next, we examined whether OS affected the number of SCs. To more accurately measure SC proliferation in the SC monoculture, we evaluated SC proliferation using 5-bromo-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog that is incorporated into the DNA of proliferating SCs when they are in the DNA replication phase (i.e., S-phase). Furthermore, SCs were cultured under four different conditions: non-transfected SCs without light emitting diode (LED) stimulation (Ctrl), non-transfected SCs with LED stimulation (Onlystim), transfected SCs without LED stimulation (Transf.), and transfected SCs with LED stimulation (OS), and were analyzed at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24&#x02009;h after the LED irradiator was applied. Through measurement of the number of SCs stained with BrdU, the specific SC cytoplasm marker S100&#x003b2;, and 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), we found that transfected SCs proliferated rapidly with OS after only 1&#x02009;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A,B</xref>). In addition, BrdU expression increased markedly with OS of SCs compared to other conditions after 1&#x02009;h, and there were no significant differences among the Ctrl, Onlystim, and Transf. groups. The number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>-S100&#x000df;<sup>+</sup>-SCs increased by about 2.6-, 2.7-, 2.4-, 2.4-, and 2.3-fold at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24&#x02009;h, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>).

To determine whether OS of SCs has an effect on the myelination process in SC-MN coculture, transfected SCs were cocultured with MNs on a coverslip precoated with Matrigel, and then stimulated with or without an LED irradiator. Differentiation and myelination of SCs in the transfected SC-MN cocultures were analyzed at DIV 7 and DIV 14 after the LED irradiator had been applied three times, (i.e., at DIVs 5, 6, and 7). To acquire samples from DIV 7, the SC-MN cocultures were incubated for 8&#x02009;h after the third LED stimulation and then fixed. Consistent with previous findings, we did not detect MBP expression in the transfected SC-MN coculture without LED stimulation (Transf.) at DIV 7. In contrast, with OS of SCs, MBP expression was initiated when observed at DIV 7, and MBP proteins were growing around the axon (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of OS on myelination was enhanced at DIV 14. MBP proteins were eventually distributed abundantly throughout the coculture of SCs with OS (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of Krox20 and MBP. With OS of SCs, we observed a strong increase of both Krox20 and MBP protein levels over time (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), consistent with the immunocytochemistry results shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>.

Before analyzing the expression of MBP protein, we examined whether pharmacological Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related interventions influenced the viability of SC-MN coculture at DIV 10. When treated with each pharmacological Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related intervention in coculture media, nearly the entire SC-MN coculture survived under each condition. These results indicate that each Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related drug does not affect the coculture viability (Suppl. Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).

In the SC monoculture, SC proliferation was substantially enhanced by OS, and the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup>-S100&#x000df;<sup>+</sup>-SCs increased over time. In addition, when dBcAMP/NRG1 was also added to SC culture medium, OS of SCs activated the expression of myelin-associated proteins such as Krox20 and MBP in dedifferentiated SCs, and the redifferentiation and remyelination of SCs was markedly upregulated. These effects of OS depend on the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level of SCs, in which the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the SC plasma membrane during OS was mainly induced by the T-type VGCC, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> was mobilized from both IP<sub>3</sub>-sensitive stores and caffeine/ryanodine-sensitive stores. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of both Krox20 and MBP is also promoted by OS in the SC-MN coculture. Conversely, the expression of these proteins was prevented by the administration of pharmacological interventions related to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, showing that OS may drive changes in diverse SC properties through the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p id="Par14">Cell proliferation and differentiation are orchestrated by various proteins related to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling inside the cell.

Due to the powerful effects of these ChR2 variants on Ca<sup>2+</sup> contribution, we favor the hypothesis that the potential effect of OS is mainly correlated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, although other complex signaling mechanisms related to the proliferation and myelination of SCs might be involved. In particular, it is well known that increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in SCs affects their proliferation, differentiation, and myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. During the SC proliferation process, the elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> via a calmodulin (calcium binding protein)-dependent mechanism regulates SC proliferation during the development and regeneration stages. At this point, Ca<sup>2+</sup> may act as a second messenger for the transduction of mitogenic signals on cultured SCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. In the SC myelination process, neuregulin-1 (NRG1), an initiator of myelination, stimulates an increase in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and simultaneously binds to erbB2 on SCs. The binding of NRG1 to erbB2 activates PLC-&#x003b3;, resulting in an elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> level and the activation of calcineurin, which results in the formation of the downstream transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) protein complex, NFATc4. The role of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway in Krox20 induction requires an increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level, which activates the expression of myelin-related genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the blockade of SC function in differentiation and myelination observed in mice lacking <italic>calcineurin B1</italic>, which inhibits the de-phosphorylation of NFAT proteins, prevents their nuclear entry into NFAT transcription complexes via a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.

In addition, exogenous ATP treatment or electrical stimulation not only induces higher intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in SCs through the P<sub>2y</sub>-purinergic pathway upstream of the SC plasma membrane, but also releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> into IP<sub>3</sub>- and ryanodine-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores; the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter can promote the myelination process in the presence or absence of axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.
