However, rTMS and CES excite all types of neuron in the target cortex probed by the coil or electrode, making it difficult to differentiate the effect of TBS on specific neural circuits involved in motor plasticity. In this study, TBS protocols were converted into an optogenetic model to achieve focalized and cell-type-specific cortical modulation. Light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was expressed in the glutamatergic neuron in the primary motor cortex (M1) driven by the CaMKII&#x003b1; promoter. A custom-made optrode comprising an optical fiber and a metal cannula electrode was fabricated to achieve optogenetic stimulation and simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recording. Single-pulse CES was delivered into M1 to elicit motor-evoked potential (MEP), which served as an indicator of motor excitability, before and after TBS intervention. Results show that both CES-iTBS and optogenetic iTBS (Opto-iTBS) can potentiate MEP activity. However, CES-cTBS suppressed MEP activity whereas Opto-cTBS enhanced it. This discrepancy may have resulted from the different neural networks targeted by the two TBS modalities, with CES-cTBS exciting all types of neuron and Opto-cTBS targeting excitatory neuron specifically. The results support the idea that intra-cortical networks determine the variation of TBS-induced neuroplasticity. This study shows that focalized and cell-type-specific brain stimulation using the optogenetic approach is viable and can be extended for further exploration of neuroplasticity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST104-2314-B-006-007-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia-Jin Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004737</institution-id><institution>National Health Research Institutes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NHRI-EX103-10139EI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jia-Jin Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors would like to thank the National Health Research Institutes of Taiwan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhri.org.tw/">http://www.nhri.org.tw/</ext-link>) (NHRI-EX103-10139EI) and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.most.gov.tw">www.most.gov.tw</ext-link>) (MOST104-2314-B-006-007-MY3) for financially supporting this study to J-JJC.

Depending on various stimulation parameters (frequency, duration, and amplitude) and patterns, such non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is capable of producing long-lasting facilitation or suppression of cortical excitability, with various behavioral and psychological effects. Among various stimulation forms of NIBS, theta burst stimulation (TBS) produces a very powerful and reproducible effect and has thus attracted increasing attention [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. By mimicking the coupling of theta and gamma rhythms in rodent electroencephalograms during learning and exploration, electrical TBS was originally applied to the hippocampus and motor cortex to induce LTP in brain slice studies [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Using rTMS, TBS protocols can induce LTP- and LTD-like effects in the human motor cortex [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The modulating effects of TBS on motor excitability was determined according to the changes in single-pulse TMS-induced electromyographic (EMG) responses, also known as motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Huang et al. found that MEPs were enhanced after intermittent TBS (iTBS) but suppressed after continuous TBS (cTBS). Related studies confirmed the effectiveness of iTBS and cTBS in modulating motor plasticity in healthy human subjects and rats [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. ITBS and cTBS patterns determine the direction of change in motor excitability and thus require shorter stimulation duration (192 s for iTBS; 40 s for cTBS) and lower intensity to induce longer-lasting effects compared to those for conventional repetitive stimulation protocols such as low-frequency (&#x02264; 1 Hz) and high-frequency (&#x02265; 5 Hz) stimulation. These properties make iTBS and cTBS more acceptable for human subjects and accessible for non-anesthetized animals.</p><p>TBS produces a strong effect and bidirectional plasticity changes, making it a potential option for diagnosis and therapy for many neurological movement disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and stroke [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the mechanism of the modulation of brain plasticity induced by TBS is still not fully understood. Epidural recordings at a high cervical level suggest that rTMS-iTBS and -cTBS regulate different interneuron networks connected to corticospinal neurons [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the case of modulation of synaptic plasticity, the parameters of the stimulation, such as temporal precision, special localization, and cellular specificity, in a neural network are important [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to studies [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] using epidural recordings, it is essential to investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> mechanisms of iTBS and cTBS by manipulating neural activity in a cell-type-specific way. A previous rodent study demonstrated that rTMS-TBS protocols are applicable for studying impaired motor plasticity in hemiparkinsonian rats [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Due to the relatively large size of the coil compared to that of the rat brain, the stimulation was not limited to the motor cortex. Cortical electrical stimulation (CES) delivered via microelectrodes has better spatial precision [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but it cannot target specific a synapse, subcellular location, or cell type. Both TMS and CES are quite non-focal and affect neural pathway interactions, which makes their results unpredictable.</p><p>The above limitations may be overcome using an emerging technique called optogenetics, which utilizes <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue-specific expression of light-sensitive channels (opsins) and allows specific neuron populations to be selectively activated or inhibited by certain wavelengths of light with millisecond temporal precision [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Because of its specificity and spatiotemporal precision, optogenetics is widely used to study the neural substrates underlying complex animal behavior [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, we investigate the role of excitatory neuron in motor plastic modulation by TBS protocols using optogenetic stimulation. CaMKII&#x003b1;-promoter-driven channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) was expressed in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex (M1) of rats. ChR2-mediated neural excitation was induced with blue laser light (473 nm) irradiation [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We designed a novel implantable optrode to guide the blue laser light into brain tissue and simultaneously collect local field potentials (LFPs) evoked by optogenetic stimulation to confirm the success of ChR2 expression. CES-induced MEPs were measured before and after TBS treatment to determine the modulating effect of TBS on motor excitability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the National Cheng Kung University Medical College Animal Use Committee (IACUC Approval No.: 104139).

The viral pellet was concentrated and then resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 1/1000<sup>th</sup> of the original volume. To determine the infection titer of the viral solution, a neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, was infected by the lentivirus at serial dilution concentrations.

Thirty minutes after anesthetization, EMG activity from the belly of the right brachioradialis muscle was recorded with needle electrodes (Axon Systems, Inc.). A reference electrode was inserted into the right paw and a ground electrode was inserted into the base of the rat&#x02019;s tail.

The minimal intensity of a single biphasic pulse required to induce a MEP of greater than 20 mV was defined as the resting motor threshold (RMT).

It is highly desirable to simultaneously record electrophysiological responses during optogenetic activation for assessing brain neural networks. In the present study, the modified optogenetic neural interface employed an implanted fiber guide to target the brain region of interest after ChR2 expression (M1 in this case), and a stainless steel fiber cannula, which allowed CES and LFP recording via a dual-function electrode. LFP evoked by optical pulses was recorded using the cannula (contact area = 0.097 mm<sup>2</sup>) from the surface of the cortex simultaneously during optogenetic stimulation. The peak-to-peak amplitude of evoked potentials increased with increasing optical intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203333.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Consistent amplitude and similar morphologies were found compared to those reported in a previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Using this custom-made neural interface, TBS protocols used for inducing LTP- or LTD-like plasticity in human M1 were converted into an optogenetic animal model, and then optical and electrical control of the rodent&#x02019;s motor activity was achieved. This study showed that single-pulse CES delivered through the custom-made optrode could elicit MEP. The obtained recordings were similar to those obtained using CES delivered through epidural screw electrodes [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By comparing the MEP amplitudes before and after TBS intervention, modulated neuroplasticity via cortical TBS can be observed. It was found that CES-iTBS induces potentiation whereas CES-cTBS inhibits MEP activity (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203333.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203333.g006">6A</xref>). These observations are similar to those for TBS-induced LTP- or LTD-like plasticity reported in our previous studies using CES and rTMS [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The TBS protocols were converted into a focal optogenetic stimulation scheme to test the after-effects on motor plasticity. A ChR2 (H134R) variant and 1-ms stimulation pulses were used in the TBS protocols to ensure spiking fidelity. Since ChR2 (H134R) can respond to stimulation with frequencies of up to 80 Hz [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], Opto-TBS with a 50-Hz intra-burst frequency could reliably activate evoked potentials in M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203333.g004">Fig 4</xref>, upper right). We found that both Opto-iTBS and Opto-cTBS can increase MEP amplitudes. The enhancement of MEP activity by Opto-iTBS was stronger than that by CES-iTBS (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203333.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203333.g006">6B</xref>). Fold change values of MEP measured at 30 min post-stimulation are: CES-iTBS: 2.57, CES-cTBS: 0.38, Opto-iTBS: 3.77, and Opto-cTBS: 2.21. The potentiating effect of the Opto-iTBS protocol on MEP activity is comparable to that for the CES- and rTMS-iTBS protocols. However, a discrepancy was observed in the case of cTBS treatment: CES- or rTMS-cTBS suppressed MEP activity whereas Opto-cTBS enhanced it. Unlike CES- or rTMS-cTBS, which typically suppressed the MEP response, Opto-cTBS enhanced it at a level similar to that of CES-iTBS.</p><p>It is hypothesized that the inconsistency between potentiation caused by Opto-cTBS versus suppression caused by CES/rTMS-cTBS may have arisen from the difference in neural networks targeted by these two TBS modalities. Some studies have indicated that the after-effects of iTBS and cTBS are mediated by different interneuron networks excited by rTMS [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Research has also shown that different TMS coil orientations can activate different intra-cortical networks, leading to approximately 50% of the variation in TBS response [<xref rid="pone.0203333.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These results indicate that the response to TBS treatment is strongly influenced by the interneuron networks recruited by the TMS pulse. There is thus a need for a focalized brain stimulation technique to selectively target neural pathways with a specific cell population. In the present study, we tested the after-effects of cell-type-specific TBS using the optogenetic approach. Since ChR2 was expressed specifically in excitatory neurons (such as pyramidal neurons) driven by the CaMKII&#x003b1; promoter, Opto-TBS should excite primarily the pyramidal neurons in a focalized area, in contrast to CES/rTMS-TBS, which activates all types of neuron, including interneurons. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the opposite modulation of neuroplasticity by Opto-cTBS compared to that of CES-cTBS may be attributed to the priming effects on different neuronal populations recruited by optogenetic and electrical/magnetic pulses. It is known that rTMS and CES approaches excite all types of cell and that optogenetic stimulation targets specific cells. Under rTMS or CES without targeting of specific cells, cTBS may suppress after-effect on cortical excitability through interneuron network. In contrast, Opto-cTBS may enhance cortical excitability when optogenetic stimulation targets excitatory neurons specifically. The major limitation of our study is that other opsin tools, such as GABAergic neurons, were not used to target interneurons in the cortex to investigate the modulating effects of TBS mediated by interneurons.</p><p>In conclusion, we developed a custom-made optogenetic neural interface, which can perform cortical recording to test the after-effects of a TBS scheme on motor plasticity in ChR2-expressing rats. Our study showed the feasibility of using the optogenetic approach for focalized and cell-type-specific modulation of neuroplasticity. Using the custom-made neural interface, TBS protocols used for testing LTP- or LTD-like plasticity in the human M1 were converted into an optogenetic animal model. It was confirmed that the potentiating effect of the Opto-iTBS protocol on MEP activity is comparable to that of CES- and rTMS-iTBS protocols. However, a discrepancy was observed in the case of cTBS treatment: CES- or rTMS-cTBS suppressed MEP activity whereas Opto-cTBS enhanced it. The results provide a better understanding of TBS-induced brain modulation and encourage further exploration of cell-type-specific brain stimulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Shaw-Jenq Tsai from the Department of Physiology, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, for providing the 293FT cell line for lentivirus production.
